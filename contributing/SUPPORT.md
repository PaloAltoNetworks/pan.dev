# Community Supported

The software in the repo are released under an as-is, best effort,
support policy. This software should be seen as community supported and Palo
Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not
provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of
the project through our normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks
support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support
options. The underlying products used may still be supported, but the support is only for the product
functionality. Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub
repository (at https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks) or sites other than our
official Downloads page on https://support.paloaltonetworks.com are provided
under the best effort policy.
