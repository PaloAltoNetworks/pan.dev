### Contributing a doc

Contributing a new document can be achieved with the following, high-level flow:

1. Create a new Markdown e.g. `your-doc-id.md` in the appropriate directory under the `docs` directory (or create a new directory)
2. Add the frontmatter (including the unique ID)
3. Add the document ID to an existing or new sidebar/sidebar category
4. Add the content

### Frontmatter

Each doc requires a frontmatter header at the top of the doc

Example:

```md
---
id: your-doc-id
title: My Awesome Tutorial
sidebar_label: My Awesome Tutorial
description: A really cool tutorial about something awesome!
keywords:
  - awesome
  - tutorial
---
```

:::note
If you're not sure where to begin, feel free to use an existing doc as boilerplate. Just remember that each document requires a unique ID.
:::

### Sidebar

The sidebar is generated from the `sidebars.js` file located in the root folder. Add your docs `id` along with path relative to the docs folder to the appropriate sidebar items.

```js {6,7}
module.exports = {
  cloud: [
    // Add your new doc inside an existing sidebar
    {
      type: "category",
      label: "Tutorials", // Category label
      items: ["tutorials/new-doc-id", "tutorials/your-doc-id"], // Document ID (including relative path after docs)
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Now you should see your doc in the sidebar in your browser (run `yarn start` if you aren't already). Next we'll see what you can do with Markdown
