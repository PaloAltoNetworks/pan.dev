The Prisma™ Cloud Application Security API enables you to check your Infrastructure-as-Code resources against
Prisma Cloud out-of-the-box and custom security policies programmatically. The Application Security API
enables you to:

- Initiate Application Security scans of repositories you've added to Prisma Cloud
- View the repositories you've connected to Application Security
- Manage Application Security suppression rules
- Fix or suppress Application Security policy violations

Use the [CSPM Policy API](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/policy) to create and manage Application Security build policies.
