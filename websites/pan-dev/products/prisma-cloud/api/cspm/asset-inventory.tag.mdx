The Asset Inventory APIs provide up-to-date information of all cloud assets that you are monitoring through Prisma Cloud.
You can request inventory data, list available filters to narrow inventory requests, and manage saved filters.

### Pagination

You can limit the number of items in a response list from API resources that support pagination. The API 
requests to list asset inventory, that supports pagination will accept the following request parameters.

Request Parameter  | Description  
-----------| -------
**limit** | Maximum number of items to return per page. Without pagination, maximum number of items to return in a response.
**offset** | Number of items to skip before selecting items to return. Default is zero.
**pageToken** | Set to the **nextPageToken** value from the previous response object to return the next page of data.

### Filters

API requests that use POST methods to request a list of asset inventory have filter parameters that enable you to narrow 
your request to inventory that meets a certain criteria. The 
[List Inventory Filters V2](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-asset-inventory-v-2-dashboard-filter-options) 
requests return the available filters.
