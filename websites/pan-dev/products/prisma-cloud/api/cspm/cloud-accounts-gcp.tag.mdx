To monitor the resources on your GCP cloud infrastructure, you must first add your GCP accounts to Prisma Cloud. When you add your cloud account to Prisma Cloud, the API integration between GCP and Prisma Cloud is established and you can begin monitoring the resources and identify potential security risks.

The Cloud Account (GCP) APIs enable you to add and manage GCP accounts on Prisma Cloud. For end to end workflow to onboarding an GCP account using APIs, see [Automate GCP Cloud Account Onboarding](/prisma-cloud/docs/cspm/gcp-account-onboarding/).
 For common operations related to cloud accounts, see [Cloud Accounts (All)](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/cloud-accounts-all/).
