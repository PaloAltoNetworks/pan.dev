Alert rules define what policy violations trigger alerts for cloud accounts within the selected account group 
and where to send the alert notifications. Alert rules give you a lot of flexibility in how you manage alerts 
and ensure that you can adhere to the administrative boundaries you have defined. You can create a single 
alert rule that alerts on all policy rules, or you can define granular alert rules that send very specific 
sets of alerts for specific cloud accounts, regions, and even resources to specific destinations.
