Permission groups enable you to restrict access to one or more features available on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. Permission group APIs allow you to retrieve, update or delete one or more existing permissions groups. You can also use these APIs to create a custom permission group and then you must attach it to a role and assign the role to a user.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
