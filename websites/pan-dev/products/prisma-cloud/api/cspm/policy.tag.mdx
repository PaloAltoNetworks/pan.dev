A policy is a set of one or more constraints or conditions that must be adhered to. Prisma Cloud provides 
predefined policies for configurations and access controls that adhere to established security best 
practices such as PCI, GDPR, ISO 27001:2013, and NIST. These Prisma Cloud default polices cannot be modified. 
In addition to these, you can create custom policies to monitor for violations and to enforce your own organizational standards.
