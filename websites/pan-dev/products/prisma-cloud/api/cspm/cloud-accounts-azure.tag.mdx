To monitor the resources on your Azure cloud infrastructure, you must first add your Azure accounts to Prisma Cloud. When you add your cloud account to Prisma Cloud, the API integration between Azure and Prisma Cloud is established and you can begin monitoring the resources and identify potential security risks.

The Cloud Account (Azure) APIs enable you to add and manage Azure accounts on Prisma Cloud. For end to end workflow to onboarding an Azure account using APIs, see [Automate Azure Cloud Account Onboarding](/prisma-cloud/docs/cspm/azure-account-onboarding/).
 For common operations related to cloud accounts, see [Cloud Accounts (All)](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/cloud-accounts-all/).
