Access Keys are a secure way to enable programmatic access to the Prisma Cloud API. By default, only 
the System Admin has API access and can enable API access for other administrators. If you have API access, 
you can create up to two access keys. Create an access key for a limited time period and regenerate your API 
keys periodically to minimize exposure and follow security best practices.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
