Creating compliance reports is the best way to monitor your cloud accounts across all cloud types and ensure that you 
are adhering to all compliance standards. You can create compliance reports based on a cloud compliance standard for 
immediate download or schedule recurring reports so you can monitor compliance to the standard over time. From a single 
report, you have a consolidated view of how well all of your cloud accounts are adhering to the selected standard. You 
can also download historic reports so that you can see your compliance trend.
