When you delete an asset in a cloud account that is onboarded on Prisma Cloud, the asset is marked as deleted. After 90 days, the configuration details of the deleted assets are archived. You can use the archiveList endpoint of this API to retrieve the configuration details of such assets as a compressed archive (.zip) file.

The compressed archive (.zip) files are available for 9 months, after which they are deleted.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
