You can use the Resource Query Language (RQL) to perform configuration checks across cloud services as well as 
gain real-time insights into user and network events to gain security visibility and create policy guardrails 
in your cloud environment. For more information, see [Prisma Cloud documentation](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/cspm-admin-guide/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/get-started-with-prisma-cloud).
