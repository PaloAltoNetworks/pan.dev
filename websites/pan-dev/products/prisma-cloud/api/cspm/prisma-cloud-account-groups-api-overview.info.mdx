<h1 className={"openapi__heading"}>Prisma Cloud Account Groups API Overview</h1>



You can use Account Groups to combine access to multiple cloud accounts with similar or different applications 
that span multiple divisions or business units, so that you can manage administrative access to these accounts 
from Prisma Cloud.

When you onboard a cloud account to Prisma Cloud, you can assign the cloud account to one or more account groups, 
and then assign the account group to Prisma Cloud Administrator Roles. Assigning an account group to an administrative 
user on Prisma Cloud allows you to restrict access only to the resources and data that pertains to the cloud account(s) 
within an account group. Alerts on Prisma Cloud are applied at the cloud account group level, which means you can set up 
separate alert rules and notification flows for different cloud environments.
