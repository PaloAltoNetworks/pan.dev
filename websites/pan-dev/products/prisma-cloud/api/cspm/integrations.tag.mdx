With multiple out-of-the-box integration options, you can integrate Prisma Cloud into security 
workflows and technologies that already exist in your organization.

**Note**: For Prisma Cloud integrations with the following, see [Integrations Pull](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/integrations-pull):

* Okta
* Qualys
* Tenable

### Integration Configuration

The model for an integration between Prisma Cloud and an external system includes
an **integrationConfig** parameter which is a map of key/value pairs. The
type of integration defines the content of these key/value pairs. See
[Integration Configurations](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/api-integration-config) for more information about
integration API request body details, including the **integrationConfig**
request parameter key/value pairs that apply to your specific integration API.
