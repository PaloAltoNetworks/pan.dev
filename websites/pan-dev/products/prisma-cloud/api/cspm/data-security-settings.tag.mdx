Prisma Cloud Data Security enables you to discover and classify data stored 
in AWS S3 buckets and protect accidental exposure, misuse, or sharing of sensitive data. You can use
the data security settings APIs to manage data profiles, data patterns, and snippets.

### Error Handling

As with other Prisma Cloud public API requests, Data Security Settings API requests return standard 
HTTP response codes. When more details are available, the error response includes the following:

Property  | Type | Description  
-----------| ---- | ----------- 
message | string | Error message
name | string | Exception name
detail | string  | Exception details      

To get started with data security, see 
[Prisma Cloud Data Security](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/cspm-admin-guide/prisma-cloud-data-security/prisma-cloud-data-security). 
If you are upgraded to the Darwin release,
