To monitor the resources on your AWS cloud infrastructure, you must first add your AWS accounts to Prisma Cloud. When you add your cloud account to Prisma Cloud, the API integration between AWS and Prisma Cloud is established and you can begin monitoring the resources and identify potential security risks.

The Cloud Account (AWS) APIs enable you to add and manage AWS accounts on Prisma Cloud. For end to end workflow to onboarding an AWS account using APIs, see [Automate AWS Cloud Account Onboarding](/prisma-cloud/docs/cspm/aws-cloud-account-onboarding/).
 For common operations related to cloud accounts, see [Cloud Accounts (All)](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/cloud-accounts-all/).
