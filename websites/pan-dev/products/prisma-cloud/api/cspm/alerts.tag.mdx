Prisma Cloud generates an alert when it detects a violation in a policy that is included in an active alert rule. 
You can use the API requests to manage alerts, including listing or viewing, snoozing or dismissing, reopening, 
or remediating alerts.

When retrieving a list of alerts through an API request, you can set filters, time range parameters, or pagination parameters.

### Pagination

You can limit the number of items in a response list from API resources that support pagination. Version 2 (V2) of the API 
requests to list alerts supports pagination and will accept the following request parameters.

Request Parameter  | Description  
-----------| -------
**limit** | Maximum number of items to return per page. Without pagination, maximum number of items to return in a response.
**offset** | Number of items to skip before selecting items to return. Default is zero.
**pageToken** | Set to the **nextPageToken** value from the previous response object to return the next page of data.

### Filters

API requests that use POST methods to request a list of alerts have filter parameters that enable you to narrow your request 
to alerts that meet a certain criteria.The [List Alert Filters](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/get-alert-filter-options) 
requests return the available filters.
