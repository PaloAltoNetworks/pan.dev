With Prisma Cloud serviceâ€™s multiple out-of-the-box integration options, you can integrate Prisma Cloud into existing 
security workflows and technologies of your organization.

You can use [Integrations V1](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/integrations) for most external integrations. Use the following API endpoints, though, for 
integrations with:

* Okta
* Qualys
* Tenable

In addition to pushing data to these external systems, Prisma Cloud also pulls data.
         
## Integration Configuration
The model for an integration between Prisma Cloud and an external system includes an **integrationConfig** parameter which 
is a map of key/value pairs. The type of integration defines the content of these key/value pairs.
See [Integration Configurations](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/api-integration-config) for more information about integration API 
request body details, including the **integrationConfig** request parameter key/value pairs that apply to your 
specific integration API.
