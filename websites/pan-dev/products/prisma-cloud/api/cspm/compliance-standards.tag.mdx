You can create your own custom compliance standards that are tailored to your own business needs, 
standards, and organizational policies. When defining a custom compliance standard, you can add 
requirements and sections. A custom compliance standard that has a minimum of one requirement and one 
section can be associated with policies that check for adherence to your standards.
