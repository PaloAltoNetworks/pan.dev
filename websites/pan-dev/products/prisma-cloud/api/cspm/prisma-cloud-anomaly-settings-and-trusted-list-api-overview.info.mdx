<h1 className={"openapi__heading"}>Prisma Cloud Anomaly Settings and Trusted List API Overview</h1>



Set the enterprise level settings to build standard training models for anomaly detection, alert disposition, 
and some other global settings such as the timeout before the user is locked out for inactivity and user 
attribution for alerts.
 Also, exclude trusted IP addresses when conducting tests for PCI compliance or penetration testing on your network. 
Any addresses included in this list do not generate alerts against the Prisma Cloud Anomaly Policies that 
detect unusual network activity such as the policies that detect internal port scan and port sweep activity, which are enabled by default.
