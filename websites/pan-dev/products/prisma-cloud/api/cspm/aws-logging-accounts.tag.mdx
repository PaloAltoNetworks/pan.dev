To ingest the VPC flow logs from Amazon S3 buckets to Prisma Cloud, you need an AWS logging account. If you need flow logs ingestion, after onboarding your AWS account, you must onboard the logging account which has the S3 bucket storing VPC flow logs for the monitored account. The APIs in this category can be used to configure and manage these logging accounts.
