To monitor the resources on your OCI or Alibaba cloud infrastructure, you must first add your OCI or Alibaba accounts to Prisma Cloud. When you add your cloud account to Prisma Cloud, the API integration between your cloud infrastructure provider and Prisma Cloud is established and you can begin monitoring the resources and identify potential security risks.

The Cloud Account (OCI and Alibaba) APIs enable you to add and manage OCI or Alibaba accounts on Prisma Cloud. For common operations related to cloud accounts, see [Cloud Accounts (All)](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/cloud-accounts-all/).
