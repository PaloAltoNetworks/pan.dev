The Data Security capabilities on Prisma Cloud enable you to discover and classify data stored 
in AWS S3 buckets and protect accidental exposure, misuse, or sharing of sensitive data. The 
data dashboard provides visibility into your S3 storage. 

To get started with data security, see 
[Prisma Cloud Data Security](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/classic/cspm-admin-guide/prisma-cloud-data-security/prisma-cloud-data-security). 
If you are upgraded to the Darwin release, 
see [Prisma Cloud Data Security](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/administration/configure-data-security/configure-data-security).
