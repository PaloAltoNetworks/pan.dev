# Strata Logging Service Log Forwarding

Your Strata Logging Service license comes with the ability to forward log data from your logging instance to external destinations such as a syslog or HTTPS server, a SIEM, or an email server.

## Getting Started with Log Forwarding

- **Activate Strata Logging Service** — Begin by [activating your Strata Logging Service license](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/strata-logging-service/administration/planning/activate) and deploying the logging instance.

- **Get Started** — Use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
