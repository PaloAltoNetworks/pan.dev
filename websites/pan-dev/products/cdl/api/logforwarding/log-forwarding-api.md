The Strata Logging Service supports the forwarding of log data to external destinations. For example, you can forward logs using syslog to a SIEM for long term storage, forward using HTTP to REST APIs, and forward email notifications of critical events to an email recipient.  

The [Log Forwarding APIs](/cdl/docs/log-forwarding/) can be used to define and manage Strata Logging Service log forwarding profiles for syslog, HTTPS, and email log destinations.

For more details on log forwarding from the Strata Logging Service, as well as the supported SIEM platform and log formats, please refer to the [Strata Logging Service documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/strata-logging-service/administration/forward-logs).

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
