# Using PAN-OS SD-WAN for Redundant Internet

**Author:** _Kevin Steves - Palo Alto Networks_

## Abstract

Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) is a technology that is
included in PAN-OS. One use case which is not explicitly covered in
the
[SD-WAN Administrator’s Guide](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sd-wan/3-0/sd-wan-admin)
is configuring SD-WAN on an Internet
firewall with redundant Internet connections (e.g., dual ISPs).

An example configuration which uses the PAN-OS SD-WAN feature to
perform load sharing and automatic Internet failover when there is
service disruption on a connection is provided.

## Configuration

In the example configuration there are two Internet connections:

1. CenturyLink DSL, 40 Mbps
2. Comcast Cable (Xfinity), 200 Mbps

Two PA-460s running PAN-OS 10.2 are deployed in an Active/Passive high
availability (HA) cluster (HA is optional). The example configuration
does not use Panorama, and can be deployed using the firewall Web
Interface or the CLI. The `set` CLI configuration statements for the
SD-WAN configuration are provided, in addition to the configuration
paths in the firewall Web Interface.

The SD-WAN topology is a single branch using Direct Internet Access
(DIA) only with no hub.

Note: The example configuration has been previously deployed on a
single PA-220 running PAN-OS 10.1.

Note: When Panorama is used to configure SD-WAN, the SD-WAN plugin
must be installed on the Panorama management server; the plugin is not
used on PAN-OS firewalls.

### Step 0: Verify SD-WAN License

A license is required to enable the SD-WAN feature:

```
  admin@PA-460-1(active)> request license info

  [...]

  License entry:
  Feature: SD WAN
  Description: License to enable SD WAN feature
  Serial: 999999999999
  Authcode:
  Issued: August 30, 2022
  Expires: August 30, 2025
  Expired?: no
```

### Step 1: Create Link Tags

Create an object tag for each of the Internet links:

```
  set tag CenturyLink
  set tag Comcast
```

**Web Interface**: _Objects->Tags_

### Step 2: Create a SD-WAN Interface Profile

Create a SD-WAN interface profile for each Internet link. The tags
created in _Step 1_ are used in the profiles (`link-tag`) and will be
used to reference the profiles in other SD-WAN objects. The example
uses the same profile name as the tag:

```
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink link-type ADSL/DSL
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink maximum-download 40
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink maximum-upload 3
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink vpn-data-tunnel-support yes
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink path-monitoring Aggressive
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink probe-frequency 5
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink failback-hold-time 120
  set sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink link-tag CenturyLink

  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast link-type Cablemodem
  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast maximum-download 200
  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast path-monitoring Aggressive
  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast probe-frequency 5
  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast failback-hold-time 120
  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast maximum-upload 5
  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast vpn-data-tunnel-support yes
  set sdwan-interface-profile Comcast link-tag Comcast
```

This configuration does not create VPN tunnels--it is a single
branch with no hub. The path monitoring mode, probe frequency, probe
idle time and fallback hold time settings apply only to VPN
tunnels. Probing is performed from the physical Ethernet interfaces to
the next hop gateway using ICMP echo request at a fixed frequency of 1
ping per second.

**Web Interface**: _Network->SD-WAN Interface Profile_

### Step 3: Configure SD-WAN Physical Ethernet Interfaces

Configure a physical layer 3 Ethernet interface for each Internet
link:

- Assign interface to a zone and virtual router
- Set an IPv4 address
  - Static: set next hop gateway
  - DHCP client: disable _Automatically create default route pointing to default gateway provided by server_
- Enable SD-WAN
- Set SD-WAN interface profile

In the example configuration, `ethernet1/1` uses a static IP address
and sets the next hop gateway (`sdwan-gateway`) and `ethernet1/2`
uses DHCP client with options `create-default-route no`.

```
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 sdwan-link-settings upstream-nat enable no
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 sdwan-link-settings upstream-nat static-ip
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 sdwan-link-settings enable yes
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 sdwan-link-settings sdwan-interface-profile CenturyLink
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 ip 192.168.0.254/24 sdwan-gateway 192.168.0.1

  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/2 layer3 sdwan-link-settings upstream-nat enable no
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/2 layer3 sdwan-link-settings upstream-nat static-ip
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/2 layer3 sdwan-link-settings enable yes
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/2 layer3 sdwan-link-settings sdwan-interface-profile Comcast
  set network interface ethernet ethernet1/2 layer3 dhcp-client create-default-route no

  set zone l3-untrust network layer3 [ ethernet1/1 ethernet1/2 ]
  set network virtual-router default interface [ ethernet1/1 ethernet1/2 ]
```

**Web Interface**: _Network->Interfaces->Ethernet->Config_

**Web Interface**: _Network->Interfaces->Ethernet->IPv4_

**Web Interface**: _Network->Interfaces->Ethernet->Advanced_

### Step 4: Configure a Virtual SD-WAN Interface

Create a virtual SD-WAN interface with an interface group containing
the two Internet interfaces, and place them in the same zone and
virtual router; the virtual interface is `sdwan.1`:

```
  set network interface sdwan units sdwan.1 interface [ ethernet1/1 ethernet1/2 ]

  set zone l3-untrust network layer3 [ ethernet1/1 sdwan.1 ethernet1/2 ]

  set network virtual-router default interface [ ethernet1/1 ethernet1/2 sdwan.1 ]
```

**Web Interface**: _Network->Interfaces->SD-WAN_

### Step 5: Create Static Routes to the SD-WAN Interface

Create a default route to the `sdwan.1` interface. Additionally, host
routes to devices connected to the interfaces in the SD-WAN interface
group may need to be created so they can be reached through a specific
interface. In the example configuration there is a router and a cable
modem that need to be reached for management:

```
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route default-sdwan interface sdwan.1
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route default-sdwan metric 10
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route default-sdwan destination 0.0.0.0/0
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route default-sdwan route-table unicast

  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route comcast-modem interface ethernet1/2
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route comcast-modem metric 10
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route comcast-modem destination 192.168.100.1/32
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route comcast-modem route-table unicast

  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route centurylink-router interface ethernet1/1
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route centurylink-router metric 10
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route centurylink-router destination 192.168.0.1/32
  set network virtual-router default routing-table ip static-route centurylink-router route-table unicast
```

**Web Interface**: _Network->Virtual Routers_

### Step 6: Configure SD-WAN Link Management Profiles

Note: An error correction profile is not used in the configuration
because Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Packet Duplication (PD)
requires the receiver to have knowledge of FEC or PD.

#### Step 6.1: Path Quality Profile

There are a number of predefined path quality profiles, many with
similar jitter, latency and packet loss values. A custom profile is
not created and the predefined `general-web` path quality profile will
be used.

**Web Interface**: _Objects->SD-WAN Link Management->Path Quality Profile_

#### Step 6.2: SaaS Quality Profile

The SaaS quality profile is a key component of the configuration--it
is used to define path quality for physical links and the preferred
path for outgoing connections.

The SaaS quality profile has 3 monitoring mode options:

1. Adaptive - passive monitoring using session packet send and receive statistics
2. Static IP Address - ping IP addresses
3. HTTP/HTTP2 - probe a URL

The `adaptive` monitoring mode works very well for the redundant
Internet use case, and it requires no additional configuration:

```
  set profiles sdwan-saas-quality saas-adaptive monitor-mode adaptive
```

**Web Interface**: _Objects->SD-WAN Link Management->SaaS Quality Profile_

#### Step 6.3: Traffic Distribution Profile

The traffic distribution profile has 3 options:

1. Best Available Path
2. Top Down Priority
3. Weighted Session Distribution

The two links have disparate bandwidth (40Mbps and 200Mbps) however
load sharing is still desired and possible. The `adaptive` SaaS
monitoring mode is used combined with best available path:

```
  set profiles sdwan-traffic-distribution traffic-best-available link-tags CenturyLink
  set profiles sdwan-traffic-distribution traffic-best-available link-tags Comcast
  set profiles sdwan-traffic-distribution traffic-best-available traffic-distribution "Best Available Path"
```

**Web Interface**: _Objects->SD-WAN Link Management->Traffic Distribution Profile_

### Step 7: Configure SD-WAN Policy Rules

Create a single outbound SD-WAN policy rule which references the link
management profiles created and the predefined `general-web` path
quality profile:

```
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas action traffic-distribution-profile traffic-best-available
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas from [ l3-internal l3-mgt l3-vm ]
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas to l3-untrust
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas source any
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas destination any
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas source-user any
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas application any
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas service any
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas path-quality-profile general-web
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas disabled no
  set rulebase sdwan rules rule0-saas saas-quality-profile saas-adaptive
```

**Web Interface**: _Policies->SD-WAN_

### Step 8: Configure SD-WAN Interface NAT Rules

Create a NAT rule for each of the Internet interfaces:

```
  set rulebase nat rules rule1 source-translation dynamic-ip-and-port interface-address interface ethernet1/1
  set rulebase nat rules rule1 to l3-untrust
  set rulebase nat rules rule1 from [ l3-internal l3-mgt l3-vm ]
  set rulebase nat rules rule1 source any
  set rulebase nat rules rule1 destination any
  set rulebase nat rules rule1 service any
  set rulebase nat rules rule1 to-interface ethernet1/1

  set rulebase nat rules rule2 source-translation dynamic-ip-and-port interface-address interface ethernet1/2
  set rulebase nat rules rule2 to l3-untrust
  set rulebase nat rules rule2 from [ l3-internal l3-mgt l3-vm ]
  set rulebase nat rules rule2 source any
  set rulebase nat rules rule2 destination any
  set rulebase nat rules rule2 service any
  set rulebase nat rules rule2 to-interface ethernet1/2
```

The `enternet1/1` interface is assigned a static private IP address.
The connected gateway is a DSL router that is performing source NAT
with its modem public IP address and NAT at the firewall is not
required, however it is used to avoid adding static routes to internal
networks on the router.

Source NAT is required on the `ethernet1/2` interface because it has a
DHCP assigned public IP address.

**Web Interface**: _Policies->NAT_

## High Availability Considerations

### Link and Path Monitoring

Do not enable HA link or path monitoring on the SD-WAN interfaces; the
SD-WAN configuration will handle link and path failures while avoiding
the need for an HA failover.

## SD-WAN Troubleshooting, Monitoring and Debugging

### SD-WAN `show sdwan` CLI Commands

There are a number of useful SD-WAN CLI commands under the `show sdwan` command tree that are useful for monitoring and
troubleshooting:

```
  admin@PA-460-1(active)> show sdwan ?
  > connection     Show SD-WAN connection information
  > details        Show SD-WAN debugging information
  > event          Show SD-WAN related events
  > path-monitor   sdwan path-monitor infomation
  > pool           Show SD-WAN shared resource usage
  > rule           Show SD-WAN rules
  > session        Show SD-WAN session information
```

#### Show SD-WAN Rule

The `show sdwan rule` CLI command displays the SD-WAN rules,
including:

- Traffic distribution method
- Tag and interface
- Latency, sensitivity (M is medium), jitter, packet loss from path quality profile

```

```

The ping monitoring in this case is for the fixed 1 ping per second
probe performed to the next hop gateway of each Ethernet
interface. Additional statistics for each interface can be displayed
using the `conn-idx` option:

```

The _connection_ number is the _idx_ from `show sdwan path-monitor stats`, and the _if_idx_ is the _if-id_. It's unclear what may cause
the very short duration state changes--the last two are each 200
milliseconds. These use a SaaS adaptive path monitoring profile.

### SD-WAN Global Counters

Add `value all` to show all counters (including zero).

Add `delta yes` to show the difference between the last command.

```
  admin@PA-460-1(active)> show counter global filter aspect sdwan

  Global counters:
  Elapsed time since last sampling: 175.814 seconds
