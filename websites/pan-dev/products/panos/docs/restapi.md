# PAN-OS REST API

Documentation for the REST API can be found [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-panorama-api), within the official technical documentation for PAN-OS.

Of particular interest would be the [Getting Started with the REST API](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-panorama-api/get-started-with-the-pan-os-rest-api) guide.

A key resource when using the REST API is the on-device documentation. This can be found at `https://HOSTNAME/restapi`, where `HOSTNAME` should be replace with the IP address or hostname of your PAN-OS appliance. The documentation will also be version-specific to the PAN-OS software currently running on the appliance.

It is also strongly advised that you read about the [differences between the XML API and REST API](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-panorama-api/about-the-pan-os-xml-api), to make an informed decision on which is most appropriate for your given use case(s).
