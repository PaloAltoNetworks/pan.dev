Welcome to the Prisma SASE Aggregate Monitoring APIs. These APIs are available to customers that
utilize Cloud Management for service onboarding, configuration, and operations.

After you have configured your tenants, these APIs can be used to perform aggregated monitoring
queries for information about applications, threats, URLs, and licenses across all your tenants of a
Prisma Access or Prisma SD-WAN instance.

The functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the [Prisma SASE Multitenant
Platform user
interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform/monitor-tenants).

See the [Prisma SASE Multitenant Platform API docs](/sase/docs/mt-monitor) for more information about
how to use the information in this API reference.

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
