You use Identity and Access Management (IAM) APIs to create Service Accounts, and to manage access policies
for users and service accounts. You can also use these APIs to examine the available roles and
permissions that you can grant to users and service accounts.

[Service accounts](/sase/docs/service-accounts) are used to obtain access tokens, and
to identify permissions for API calls.

SASE uses [roles](/sase/docs/roles) to identify what access a service or user account has
to the various SASE products and services.

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
