For Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) address objects, DNS provides the FQDN resolution to the IP addresses eliminating the need to manually update them every time you resolve a new IP address.

These are the following formats for FQDN.  

- Host names are composed of a sequence of labels concatenated with dots
- Each label must be from 1 to 63 characters long
- The entire host name, including the delimiting dots, has a maximum of 253 ASCII characters
- DNS names can contain only alphabetical characters (A-Z), numeric characters (0-9), minus sign (-), and period (.)  

For more information, see [FQDN formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname).
