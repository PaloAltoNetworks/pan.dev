Cloud NGFW for AWS supports local and global rulestacks. The Local Account Administrator manages local rulestacks. The AWS Firewall Manager Administrator manages the global rulestacks across the NGFWs in different AWS accounts within the AWS organization.
The AWS Firewall Manager Administrator can author a Firewall Manager Service (FMS) policy and associate a global rulestack to it.

>**Note:** The maximum local and global rulestacks you can create per subscription is 10.
>**Note:** A Local Account Administrator cannot create a FMS policy. When a FMS service handshake is established, any existing Local Account Administrator calls are disabled.
