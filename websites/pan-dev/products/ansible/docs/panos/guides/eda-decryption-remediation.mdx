# Use Event-Driven Ansible for Decryption Remediation

In this guide, you will configure PAN-OS and Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) to perform remediation for issues arising when a forward proxy decryption policy is implemented.

When forward proxy decryption is implemented on PAN-OS, there are potential challenges faced due to traffic which can't be decrypted, or which when decrypted causes errors or warnings. A common occurrence is websites which incorrectly do not present the certificate of the intermediate CA which signed the website's own certificate; when forward proxy decryption is performed for these websites, the user is presented with a browser warning due to an untrusted certificate. The use case for EDA in this guide is to detect when this happens, and remediate the situation automatically.

<Assumptions />

- a working EDA controller, either as part of an Ansible Automation Platform deployment, or as a standalone server. Please consult [the Red Hat documentation](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/event-driven-ansible) for more details on deploying EDA.<br/><br/>

## Configure PAN-OS to send decryption failure logs to EDA

The EDA plugin in the PAN-OS Ansible Collection is capable of receiving events as JSON structured log messages, which are sent by PAN-OS (firewall or Panorama). A HTTP Server Profile is required to define the structure of the log messages, with a payload definition like this:

```json
{
    "category": "network",
    "details": {
        "action": "$action",
        "app": "$app",
        "cn": "$cn",
        "dst": "$dst",
        "device_name": "$device_name",
        "error": "$error",
        "issuer_cn": "$issuer_cn",
        "root_cn": "$root_cn",
        "root_status": "$root_status",
        "sni": "$sni",
        "src": "$src",
        "srcuser": "$srcuser"
    },
    "receive_time": "$receive_time",
    "rule": "$rule",
    "rule_uuid": "$rule_uuid",
    "serial": "$serial",
    "sessionid": "$sessionid",
    "severity": "informational",
    "type": "decryption"
}
```

Rather than configure this manually, the HTTP Server Profile could be configured in its entirety using the following tasks in an Ansible playbook, using the `server_profile_name_decrypt` variable for the name of the profile:

```yaml
    - name: Create a HTTP Server Profile for Decryption Logs
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_http_profile:
        provider: '{{ device }}'
        name: '{{ server_profile_name_decrypt }}'
        decryption_name: 'decryption-logs-to-eda'
        decryption_uri_format: 'https://test'
        decryption_payload: >
          {
              "category": "network",
              "details": {
                  "action": "$action",
                  "app": "$app",
                  "cn": "$cn",
                  "dst": "$dst",
                  "device_name": "$device_name",
                  "error": "$error",
                  "issuer_cn": "$issuer_cn",
                  "root_cn": "$root_cn",
                  "root_status": "$root_status",
                  "sni": "$sni",
                  "src": "$src",
                  "srcuser": "$srcuser"
              },
              "receive_time": "$receive_time",
              "rule": "$rule",
              "rule_uuid": "$rule_uuid",
              "serial": "$serial",
              "sessionid": "$sessionid",
              "severity": "informational",
              "type": "decryption"
          }

    - name: Create HTTP server
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_http_server:
        provider: '{{ device }}'
        http_profile: '{{ server_profile_name_decrypt }}'
        name: 'my-EDA-server'
        address: '192.168.1.5'
        http_method: 'GET'
        http_port: 5000

    - name: Add a HTTP header to HTTP Server Profile
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_http_profile_header:
        provider: '{{ device }}'
        http_profile: '{{ server_profile_name_decrypt }}'
        log_type: 'decryption'
        header: 'Content-Type'
        value: 'application/json'

    - name: Add a param to the config log type
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_http_profile_param:
        provider: '{{ device }}'
        http_profile: '{{ server_profile_name_decrypt }}'
        log_type: 'decryption'
        param: 'serial'
        value: '$serial'
```

Once configured, the HTTP Server Profile would be used in a Log Forwarding Profile, with a filter for only forwarding Decryption Logs when there has been an issue with decryption. Here are example Ansible tasks to create a Log Forwarding Profile:

```yaml
    - name: Create log forwarding profile
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_log_forwarding_profile:
        provider: '{{ provider }}'
        name: 'EDA_LFP'
        enhanced_logging: true

    - name: Create log forwarding profile match list
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_log_forwarding_profile_match_list:
        provider: '{{ provider }}'
        log_forwarding_profile: 'EDA_LFP'
        name: 'eda-decryption-forwarding'
        log_type: 'decryption'
        filter: '( err_index neq None ) and ( proxy_type eq Forward )'
        http_profiles: ['{{ server_profile_name_decrypt }}']
```

Ensure any configuration changes to PAN-OS are committed before proceeding.

PAN-OS will now forward logs to EDA as events, whenever there are decryption failures recorded in the Decryption Logs.

## Implement an EDA Rulebook to Receive Events from PAN-OS

Rulebooks are YAML files which describe events of interest, and how EDA should respond to them based on conditions. Please consult [the Red Hat documentation](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/event-driven-ansible) for more details on how to deploy rulebooks in EDA.

Deploying the rulebook below configures EDA to be able to receive the decryption logs (configured in the previous steps) from PAN-OS on TCP port 5000, and execute a remediation playbook:

```yaml

    ---
    - name: "Receive logs sourced from HTTP Server Profile in PAN-OS"
      hosts: "localhost"

      ## Define how our plugin should listen for logs from PAN-OS
      sources:
        - paloaltonetworks.panos.logs:
            host: 0.0.0.0
            port: 5000
            type: decryption

      ## Define the conditions we are looking for. There are many types of logs
      ## in PAN-OS; we are looking just for decryption logs
      rules:
        - name: "Troubleshoot Decryption Failure"
          condition: event.meta.log_type == "decryption"

          ## Define the action we should take should the condition be met,
          ## when we find a decryption log, which is to execute the 
          ## remediation playbook
          action:
            run_playbook:
              name: "playbooks/decryption_remediation.yml"
```

## Define a Playbook to Remediate Decryption Issues

Having configured PAN-OS to send events to EDA to initiate the event-driven workflow, and having implemented a rulebook to process the events and trigger a remediation playbook, the final step is to define the playbook used for remediation tasks.

Two options are defined here, and other options for remediation could be considered also:
- Add the problematic URL to a category used to bypass decryption, removing decryption for the URL in question, but also losing full visibility of traffic to that URL
- Add the missing intermediate certificate to the PAN-OS certificate, which recovers the root cause of the problem when the website in question is misconfigured to not present the intermediate certificate

### Decryption Bypass

This playbook can be used for the option to bypass decryption for the problematic website:

```yaml
---
- name: Decryption Remediation Playbook
  hosts: 'all'
  gather_facts: false
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "192.168.1.1"
      username: "admin"
      password: "redacted"

    bypass_category_name: 'decryption-bypass'

  ## When EDA calls this playbook for execution, it takes the SNI (Server Name Indication)
  ## from the decryption logs where a site failed to be decrypted properly, and adds the
  ## SNI to the list of domains in a URL category. This URL category is used as match
  ## criteria, therefore domains in this URL category will no longer be decrypted by the
  ## decryption policy rule.

  tasks:
    ## Gather up the list of domains currently in the URL category
    - name: Get current decryption bypass domains
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_custom_url_category:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        state: "gathered"
        gathered_filter: "name == '{{ bypass_category_name }}'"
      register: bypass_category

    ## If the URL category already has some domains, add this SNI to the list ('url_value')
    - name: Update decryption bypass category with new domain, if category is currently not empty
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_custom_url_category:
        provider: '{{ device }}'
        name: '{{ bypass_category_name }}'
        url_value: '{{ bypass_category.gathered[0].url_value + [ansible_eda.event.payload.details.sni] }}'
      when:
        - bypass_category.gathered[0].url_value != None
        - ansible_eda.event.payload.details.sni not in bypass_category.gathered[0].url_value

    ## If the URL category is empty, create the list ('url_value') with this SNI
    - name: Create decryption bypass category with new domain, if category is currently empty
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_custom_url_category:
        provider: '{{ device }}'
        name: '{{ bypass_category_name }}'
        url_value: '{{ [ansible_eda.event.payload.details.sni] }}'
      when:
        - bypass_category.gathered[0].url_value == None

    ## Having added the site's SNI to the URL category, make this change live by performing a 'commit'
    - name: Commit configuration
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_commit_firewall:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
      register: results

    ## Output results of the commit
    - name: Output commit results
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Commit with Job ID: {{ results.jobid }} had output: {{ results }}"
```

### Install Missing Intermediate Certificate

This playbook can be used for the option to install the missing intermediate certificate for the problematic website:

```yaml
---
- name: Decryption Remediation Playbook
  hosts: 'all'
  gather_facts: false
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "192.168.1.1"
      username: "admin"
      password: "redacted"

  ## When EDA calls this playbook for execution, it takes the AIA (Authority Information Access)
  ## from the decryption logs where a site failed to be decrypted properly, and attempts to
  ## download the missing intermediate certificate which was not presented by the website the
  ## user tried to access, then install the certificate into the PAN-OS certificate store.

  tasks:
    # Using the AIA in the Decryption Logs, get the URL for the location of the intermediate certificate
    - name: Get intermediate certificate URL
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        intermediate_cert_url: "{{ ansible_eda.event.payload.details.error | regex_search(regex_query, ignorecase=True) }}"
      vars:
        regex_query: '(http(s)?:\/\/.)?(www\.)?[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&//=]*)'

    # Parse out just the name of certificate, to be used as the certificate name in the PAN-OS certificate store
    - name: Get intermediate certificate filename
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        intermediate_cert_name: "{{ intermediate_cert_url | regex_search(regex_query, ignorecase=True) }}"
      vars:
        regex_query: '[^\/\\&\?]+\.\w{3,4}(?=([\?&].*$|$))'

    # Download the intermediate certificate
    - name: Download intermediate certificate
      ansible.builtin.get_url:
        url: '{{ intermediate_cert_url }}'
        dest: './{{ intermediate_cert_name }}'

    # Convert the certificate into PEM format for PAN-OS
    - name: Convert intermediate certificate from DER format to PEM format
      ansible.builtin.command: "openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in {{ intermediate_cert_name }} -out ./{{ intermediate_cert_name }}.pem"
      register: output
      changed_when: output.rc != 0

    # Upload the certificate to PAN-OS
    - name: Import intermediate certificate to NGFW
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_import:
        provider: '{{ device }}'
        category: 'certificate'
        certificate_name: '{{ intermediate_cert_name }}'
        format: 'pem'
        filename: './{{ intermediate_cert_name }}.pem'

    ## Having added the certificate to the store, make this change live by performing a 'commit'
    - name: Commit configuration
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_commit_firewall:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
      register: results

    ## Output results of the commit
    - name: Output commit results
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Commit with Job ID: {{ results.jobid }} had output: {{ results }}"
```

After either remediation playbook is executed successfully, the user should be able to browse to the website without receiving the browser warning, and the entire process was automated.
