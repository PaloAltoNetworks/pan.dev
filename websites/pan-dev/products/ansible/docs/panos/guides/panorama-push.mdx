# Configure, Commit and Push with Panorama

In this guide, you will make configuration changes on Panorama within a Device Group. You will then commit the changes to Panorama, then push the changes to the managed devices (firewalls).

<Assumptions />

<LabGuidance />

## Create playbook files and define connectivity to Panorama

Create a new Ansible yaml file named `device-group-changes-commit-and-push.yml`, establish a variable block called `device` for Panorama, and reference the PAN-OS collection:

```yaml
---
- name: Commit and Push with Panorama
  hosts: '{{ target | default("panorama") }}'
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "{{ ip_address }}"
      username: "{{ username | default(omit) }}"
      password: "{{ password | default(omit) }}"
      api_key: "{{ api_key | default(omit) }}"

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos
```

## Make configuration changes

Start the playbook tasks by defining the desired configuration state; you create some new configuration elements within the Device Group:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Create address object
    panos_address_object:
      provider: "{{ device }}"
      device_group: "lab-device-group"
      name: "Object-One"
      value: "1.1.1.1"

  - name: Create service object
    panos_service_object:
      provider: "{{ device }}"
      device_group: "lab-device-group"
      name: "tcp-12345"
      destination_port: "12345"

  - name: Add security rule
    panos_security_rule:
      provider: "{{ device }}"
      device_group: "lab-device-group"
      rule_name: "Allow SSH on port 12345"
      source_zone: ["internet"]
      source_ip: ["any"]
      destination_zone: ["dmz"]
      destination_ip: ["Object-One"]
      application: ["ssh"]
      service: ["tcp-12345"]
      action: "allow"
```

## Commit to Panorama

Continue the tasks with a commit operation on Panorama for the configuration changes just made:

```yaml
- name: Commit candidate configuration
  panos_commit_panorama:
    provider: "{{ device }}"
  register: results
- debug:
    msg: "Commit with job ID: {{ results.jobid }} had output: {{ results.details }}"
```

## Push to Managed Devices

Continue the tasks with a push (and commit) to the managed devices in the Device Group:

```yaml
- name: Commit and Push template configuration
  panos_commit_push:
    provider: "{{ device }}"
    style: "device group"
    name: "lab-device-group"
    include_template: no
  register: results
- debug:
    msg: "Push with job ID: {{ results.jobid }} finished"
```

## Final playbook

Putting all the sections together, the playbook in entirety looks like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Commit and Push with Panorama
  hosts: '{{ target | default("panorama") }}'
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "{{ ip_address }}"
      username: "{{ username | default(omit) }}"
      password: "{{ password | default(omit) }}"
      api_key: "{{ api_key | default(omit) }}"

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos

  tasks:
    - name: Create address object
      panos_address_object:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        device_group: "lab-device-group"
        name: "Object-One"
        value: "1.1.1.1"

    - name: Create service object
      panos_service_object:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        device_group: "lab-device-group"
        name: "tcp-12345"
        destination_port: "12345"

    - name: Add security rule
      panos_security_rule:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        device_group: "lab-device-group"
        rule_name: "Allow SSH on port 12345"
        source_zone: ["internet"]
        source_ip: ["any"]
        destination_zone: ["dmz"]
        destination_ip: ["Object-One"]
        application: ["ssh"]
        service: ["tcp-22"]
        action: "allow"

    - name: Commit candidate configuration
      panos_commit_panorama:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
      register: results

    - debug:
        msg: "Commit with job ID: {{ results.jobid }} had output: {{ results.details }}"

    - name: Commit and Push template configuration
      panos_commit_push:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        style: "device group"
        name: "lab-device-group"
        include_template: no
      register: results

    - debug:
        msg: "Push with job ID: {{ results.jobid }} finished"
```
