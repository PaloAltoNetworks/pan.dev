# Setting up

In this tutorial we will get setup ready to execute Ansible playbooks for PAN-OS.

## Assumptions

This tutorial/guide assumes:

- you have access to a Linux-based machine, with administrative credentials
- the machine has working connectivity and access to the Internet to download content
- the machine has working connectivity and access to either a PAN-OS next-generation firewall or Panorama

## Install Ansible

1. Install Ansible. The exact steps will differ based on your operating system and environment. The Ansible documentation describes the steps required [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

2. Test Ansible installed correctly. Execute this command:

```
ansible --version
```

3. You should see an output like this (exact version numbers will differ):

```
ansible [core 2.12.6]
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/Users/username/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /Users/username/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /Users/username/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /Users/username/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.10.4 (main, May 24 2022, 14:08:56) [Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)]
  jinja version = 3.1.2
  libyaml = True
```

## Install PAN-OS Python packages

1. Install the required Python packages. Execute this command:

```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-ansible/develop/requirements.txt
```

2. Test the packages installed correctly. Execute this command:

```
pip list | grep pan
```

3. You should see an output like this (exact version numbers will differ):

```
pan-os-python                 1.7.3
pan-python                    0.17.0
```

## Install the PAN-OS collection of Ansible modules

1. Install the modules from Ansible's Galaxy repository. Execute this command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install paloaltonetworks.panos
```

2. Test the collection installed correctly. Execute this command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection list | grep panos
```

3. You should see an output like this (exact version numbers will differ):

```
paloaltonetworks.panos 2.11.0
```

## Setup the Ansible inventory

1. In the directory where you will store your Ansible playbook files, create a file called `inventory.txt` with the following content:

```
firewall
panorama
```

2. Create a sub-directory called `host_vars`
3. Within the `host_vars` directory, create a file call `firewall.yml` with the following content, changing the values for `ip_address`, `username` and `password` as appropriate:

```
---
ip_address: "192.168.1.1"
username: "admin"
password: "admin"
```

:::caution
Note that for these learning examples, we are storing PAN-OS credentials in a file on disk. This is not a production-level solution, and other solutions for managing secrets should be considered for real-world deployments. Ansible (Red Hat) and many others have solutions for this.
::: 5. Use the following command to have `ansible-vault` encrypt the files with credentials:

```
ansible-vault encrypt firewall.yml
ansible-vault encrypt panorama.yml
```

Using this command, `ansible-vault` will request a password to be used for accessing the encrypted file at a later date:

```
New Vault password:
Confirm New Vault password:
Encryption successful
```
