Architectures</a> in {props.cloudname}, deployed entirely by Terraform.</p>

<p>Reference Architectures offer organizations a validated, reliable, and scalable
solution for securing their cloud environments. These reference architectures provide
proven best practices and guidelines for deploying VM-Series firewalls in
various {props.cloudname} configurations, ensuring optimal security and
performance.</p>

<p>By leveraging Terraform, organizations can easily automate the
deployment and management of VM-Series instances, enabling rapid provisioning
and consistent enforcement of security policies. This integration of Palo Alto
Networks VM-Series with Terraform simplifies the process of deploying and
maintaining robust security infrastructure in {props.cloudname}, allowing
organizations to focus on their core business objectives while ensuring their
cloud workloads remain protected.</p>

<p>Each Reference Architecture built with Terraform leverages Terraform Modules
offered by Palo Alto Networks to build and deploy the architecture. The
Terraform Modules can also be used directly to customize the architecture.</p>
