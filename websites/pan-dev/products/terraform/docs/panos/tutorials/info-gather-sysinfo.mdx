# Information Gathering Tasks

With this Terraform code, you will gather information from a PAN-OS next-generation firewall. This is useful on its own in order to gather data, but the gathered data can also be used to feed into other Terraform operations.

<Assumptions />

<LabGuidance />

## Getting Terraform Ready

This Terraform operation gathers a number of system information items from a PAN-OS next-generation firewall.

1. Create a file called `get-system-info.tf` and paste in the following content:

<TutorialInit />

## Getting the "system info"

1. Add the following code to the bottom of the existing `get-system-info.tf` file:

```hcl
data "panos_system_info" "ngfw_info" { }

output "the_info" {
    value = data.panos_system_info.ngfw_info
}
```

2. Instruct Terraform to inspect the firewall and gather data by executing the following command:

```
terraform plan
```

3. The output should look something like this (truncated for brevity):

```hcl
+ the_info = {
    + id            = "10.110.255.4"
    + info          = {
        "app-version" = "8468-6979"
        "av-version" = "0"
        "cloud-mode" = "cloud"
        "default-gateway" = "10.110.255.1"
        "device-certificate-status" = "None"
        "device-dictionary-version" = "1-211"
        "devicename" = "lab-fw"
        "family" = "vm"
        .
        .
        .
        "wildfire-rt" = "Disabled"
        "wildfire-version" = "0"
        }
    + version_major = 10
    + version_minor = 1
    + version_patch = 8
    }
```

## Final code

Putting all the sections together, the code in entirety looks like this:

```hcl
# Define required Terraform providers
terraform {
  required_providers {
    panos = {
      source  = "paloaltonetworks/panos"
      version = "~> 1.11.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the PAN-OS provider for Terraform
provider "panos" {
  hostname = var.panos_hostname
  username = var.panos_username
  password = var.panos_password
}

variable "panos_hostname" {
  type    = string
  default = "192.168.1.1"
}

variable "panos_username" {
  type    = string
  default = "admin"
}

variable "panos_password" {
  type    = string
  default = "admin"
}

# Define the data we want to gather, the PAN-OS "system info"
data "panos_system_info" "ngfw_info" {}

# Output the data
output "the_info" {
  value = data.panos_system_info.ngfw_info
}
```
