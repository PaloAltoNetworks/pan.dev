Manage (create, modify, delete) groups in the system.
If you integrated OpenLDAP, AD, or SAML, you can re-use groups from there, and assign roles to them as appropriate.
Otherwise, create Prisma Cloud Compute local groups to manage privileges for groups of users.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
