  "description": "In keeping with the GCP resource hierarchy, you can choose whether you want Prisma Cloud to monitor one or more GCP Projects or all projects that are under your GCP Organization. If you want to onboard multiple projects, you must either onboard each project separately or allow Prisma Cloud to automatically onboard all GCP projects attached to the service account linked to the onboarded project. Prisma Cloud refers to this service account as a Master Service Account.",
