It wasn\u2019t just fear of the unknown. There was a real sense that these concepts could radically alter our digital way of life. It was intimidating, especially for someone coming from an IT and network security background. It felt counterintuitive to embrace something that could lead to my own workplace obsolescence (a tension so intriguing to me that it led to an Ignite \u201918 talk titled \u201c<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sserrata/how-to-automate-yourself-out-of-a-job-and-why-you-should">How to Automate Yourself Out of a Job (and why you should)</a>\u201d which had a more optimistic take on workplace obsolescence).</p>\n<p>So, with <a href="https://igniteusa.paloaltonetworks.com/">Ignite </a>\u201919 fast approaching (and ideas for live demos running thin!) I decided it was time to plunge right into the AI/ML abyss. It began with a simple question: \u201cCould security posture be forecasted like the weather?\u201d Armed with the Cortex\u2122 Data Lake and the <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pancloud">pancloud SDK</a>, I set out knowing that I, at least, had the data. All that remained was to find a suitable ML methodology for conducting my experiment.</p>\n<h3>Finding the Right\u00a0Tool</h3>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MSm4kz4INUPevAEutrc80Q.jpeg"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cbyoung?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Clark Young</a> on\u00a0<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/tool?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>I was attempting to predict the flow of critical severity threats in my environment which reminded me of weather and stock market forecasting.</blockquote>\n<p>I quickly learned that, for a beginner, it\u2019s easy to be led astray, especially given the multitude of libraries and tools available and the many blog articles and tutorials written for\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to know where to begin without a well-defined hypothesis in mind, so my suggestion here is to think deeply about the particular question you wish to answer and then find a way to ask that question in the simplest way possible. Better yet, consider whether your question has been asked before. In my case, I was attempting to predict the flow of critical severity threats in my environment which reminded me of weather and stock market forecasting. So, that\u2019s how I framed my\u00a0search.</p>\n<h3>Enter Facebook\u00a0Prophet</h3>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3b6J9lKY6_aPSvmoA9jXYA.jpeg"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@franckinjapan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Franck V.</a> on\u00a0<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/future?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>Behold. Time-series forecasting in a few lines of\u00a0code!</blockquote>\n<p>After a few dozen searches and a few hours of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> tutorials, I (conveniently) determined that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">Recurrent Neural Network</a> (RNN) might be overkill for the particular dataset I was working with. More importantly, diving in RNNs for me, at the time, meant spending more hours of my life in the \u201cvalley of\u00a0suck.\u201d</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/444/1*gOnpspsboCSH4xQY-xsfNw.png"><figcaption>Absolutely nowhere anyone wants to\u00a0be!</figcaption></figure><p>No. I needed something quick and easy and my dataset consisted solely of two columns: datestamp (hourly) and the number of critical severity threats observed at each interval (see Fig\u00a01).</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/294/1*fZZmXeyJQFT-BB2aABgu8Q.png"><figcaption>Fig 1: The last 5 rows of my\u00a0dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>When I first encountered Facebook\u2019s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Prophet</a> library I almost couldn\u2019t believe it. How could this library not be in the top results when searching for \u201ctime series forecasting with python\u201d? A quick glance at the quickstart left me feeling like I was finally on the right track, especially since Prophet appeared to abstract and simplify the more tedious <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sci-kit learn</a> tutorials I had already become familiar\u00a0with.</p>\n<p>Behold. Time-series forecasting in a few lines of\u00a0code!</p>\n<a href="https://medium.com/media/fd33bcec34551bc4169d2a64cce7746a/href">https://medium.com/media/fd33bcec34551bc4169d2a64cce7746a/href</a><h3>Too good to be\u00a0true?</h3>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/540/1*xu_9x3co9enBimjqpGlp_A.jpeg"><figcaption>From the movie \u201cPi\u201d\u00a0(1998)</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Forecasting the flow of critical severity threats is a lot like trying to predict the flow of the stock\u00a0market</blockquote>\n<p>If you\u2019re skeptical, it\u2019s for a good reason. Forecasting the flow of critical severity threats is a lot like trying to predict the flow of the stock market, although even that might be <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/predicting-the-stock-market-is-easier-than-you-might-think-4f1e0bc05cfe">easier than you think</a>.

It wasn\u2019t just fear of the unknown. There was a real sense that these concepts could radically alter our digital way of life. It was intimidating, especially for someone coming from an IT and network security background. It felt counterintuitive to embrace something that could lead to my own workplace obsolescence (a tension so intriguing to me that it led to an Ignite \u201918 talk titled \u201c<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sserrata/how-to-automate-yourself-out-of-a-job-and-why-you-should">How to Automate Yourself Out of a Job (and why you should)</a>\u201d which had a more optimistic take on workplace obsolescence).</p>\n<p>So, with <a href="https://igniteusa.paloaltonetworks.com/">Ignite </a>\u201919 fast approaching (and ideas for live demos running thin!) I decided it was time to plunge right into the AI/ML abyss. It began with a simple question: \u201cCould security posture be forecasted like the weather?\u201d Armed with the Cortex\u2122 Data Lake and the <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pancloud">pancloud SDK</a>, I set out knowing that I, at least, had the data. All that remained was to find a suitable ML methodology for conducting my experiment.</p>\n<h3>Finding the Right\u00a0Tool</h3>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MSm4kz4INUPevAEutrc80Q.jpeg"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cbyoung?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Clark Young</a> on\u00a0<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/tool?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>I was attempting to predict the flow of critical severity threats in my environment which reminded me of weather and stock market forecasting.</blockquote>\n<p>I quickly learned that, for a beginner, it\u2019s easy to be led astray, especially given the multitude of libraries and tools available and the many blog articles and tutorials written for\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to know where to begin without a well-defined hypothesis in mind, so my suggestion here is to think deeply about the particular question you wish to answer and then find a way to ask that question in the simplest way possible. Better yet, consider whether your question has been asked before. In my case, I was attempting to predict the flow of critical severity threats in my environment which reminded me of weather and stock market forecasting. So, that\u2019s how I framed my\u00a0search.</p>\n<h3>Enter Facebook\u00a0Prophet</h3>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3b6J9lKY6_aPSvmoA9jXYA.jpeg"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@franckinjapan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Franck V.</a> on\u00a0<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/future?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>Behold. Time-series forecasting in a few lines of\u00a0code!</blockquote>\n<p>After a few dozen searches and a few hours of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> tutorials, I (conveniently) determined that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">Recurrent Neural Network</a> (RNN) might be overkill for the particular dataset I was working with. More importantly, diving in RNNs for me, at the time, meant spending more hours of my life in the \u201cvalley of\u00a0suck.\u201d</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/444/1*gOnpspsboCSH4xQY-xsfNw.png"><figcaption>Absolutely nowhere anyone wants to\u00a0be!</figcaption></figure><p>No. I needed something quick and easy and my dataset consisted solely of two columns: datestamp (hourly) and the number of critical severity threats observed at each interval (see Fig\u00a01).</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/294/1*fZZmXeyJQFT-BB2aABgu8Q.png"><figcaption>Fig 1: The last 5 rows of my\u00a0dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>When I first encountered Facebook\u2019s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Prophet</a> library I almost couldn\u2019t believe it. How could this library not be in the top results when searching for \u201ctime series forecasting with python\u201d? A quick glance at the quickstart left me feeling like I was finally on the right track, especially since Prophet appeared to abstract and simplify the more tedious <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sci-kit learn</a> tutorials I had already become familiar\u00a0with.</p>\n<p>Behold.
