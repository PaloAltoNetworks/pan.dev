Cloud hosting providers began offering access to dynamic infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms. As these platforms grew and began offering more sophisticated infrastructure services, the complexity of a traditional systems administration role also grew. The need to rapidly configure and manage expanding cloud infrastructures quickly became a challenge.</p>\n<p>In 2011, AWS introduced CloudFormation, a service that helps model and set up AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run on AWS. With CloudFormation you could create a template that describes all the AWS resources you want to use (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS database instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You no longer have to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that for you.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#hashicorp-terraform-0-1\" aria-label=\"hashicorp terraform 0 1 permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>HashiCorp Terraform 0.1</h2>\n<p>Over time, though, a need grew for an environment-agnostic solution; a tool that could provide the same workflows, no matter what application you were using. The best, and maybe the only way to do this, was through the power of an open source ecosystem. In 2014, HashiCorp released <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-announcement\">Terraform 0.1</a>, an open source, cloud-agnostic <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code\">infrastructure as code</a> solution. Terraform 0.1 supported AWS resources at release. The idea was to start there and extend this automated provisioning workflow to any infrastructure simply by adding a new provider for that specific piece of infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#terraform-s-growth\" aria-label=\"terraform s growth permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Terraform\u2019s Growth</h2>\n<p>Terraform was far from an overnight success. Downloads were mostly stagnant for the first 18 months, and at one point shutting down the project <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/the-story-of-hashicorp-terraform-with-mitchell-hashimoto\">was considered</a>. The team at HashiCorp believed that Terraform would succeed primarily based on the ecosystem created around it; that is, the providers it would support. Building this ecosystem required an active and vibrant open source community. So Terraform was built to be easy to write and easy to use, and continued to iterate on the core workflow to ensure it solved real world problems.</p>\n<p>By the end of 2016 Terraform had more than 750 contributors. In 2017, HashiCorp launched the first provider program to help partners and communities build, post, and maintain providers. In that same year, the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/\">Terraform Registry</a> launched to enable partners and community to compose and share modules. Downloads began to double every month as new modules and providers were added.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#scaling-terraform\" aria-label=\"scaling terraform permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Scaling Terraform</h2>\n<p>From 2018 to 2020, HashiCorp began to put more focus on commercializing Terraform. This was an important step to ensure the open source project and the company behind it were sustainable. HashiCorp released Terraform Enterprise and Terraform Cloud and began adding large organizations as paying customers. Meanwhile, HashiCorp continued to iterate on Terraform and released the largest, most impactful open source release,  <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-0-1-2-preview\">Terraform 0.12</a>, in 2018.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#terraform-beyond-the-basics-with-aws\" aria-label=\"terraform beyond the basics with aws permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Terraform: Beyond the Basics with AWS</h2>\n<p>AWS supported Terraform in 2016 by publishing one of the most popular AWS Partner Network (APN) blog posts of all time \u2014 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/terraform-beyond-the-basics-with-aws/\">Terraform: Beyond the Basics with AWS</a>.

But what about authorization?</p>\n<p>One NF in particular is especially crucial in the context of security: the Network Repository Function (NRF) is responsible for dynamically registering all SBA components as they come online, acting as a kind of service discovery mechanism that can be queried in order to locate healthy services. In addition, the NRF has universal awareness of which functions should be permitted to freely communicate, issuing appropriately scoped OAuth2 tokens to each entity. These tokens authorize network flows between NFs, further securing the fabric.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667318319-nf-service-consumer-producer-edited.png\" alt=\"NF\" authentication and authorization flow><p><em>NF authentication and authorization flow</em></p>\n<p>There are two modes of service-to-service communication described in the <a href=\"https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs\">3GPP specifications</a>. In the Direct Communication mode, NFs engage in service discovery and inter-function network operations as explained above. However, in the Indirect Communication mode, a Service Control Proxy (SCP) may optionally intercept flows and even broker discovery requests with the NRF on behalf of a consumer. Various SCP implementations can augment SBA service networking by introducing intelligent load balancing and failover, policy-based controls, and monitoring.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#if-it-looks-like-a-mesh-walks-like-a-mesh\" aria-label=\"if it looks like a mesh walks like a mesh permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>If it Looks Like a Mesh, Walks Like a Mesh\u2026</h2>\n<p>To summarize, the 5G SBA includes a number of broad technology constructs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microservice architecture based on Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Hybrid-cloud/multi-cloud capabilities</li>\n<li>Service discovery and load balancing</li>\n<li>Network authentication via mTLS</li>\n<li>OAuth2 token-based authorization</li>\n<li>Optional proxy-based mode (policy and telemetry)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this is starting to sound familiar, you\u2019re not alone. While the indirect communication mode is optional (and does not specify a sidecar proxy), these elements combined closely resemble a modern, zero trust service mesh. Intentional or not, this emergent pattern could evolve towards the same architectural trends, platforms, and abstractions being adopted elsewhere in modern software.</p>\n<p>To that end, HashiCorp\u2018s enterprise products cater to a variety of core 5G use cases, with tight Kubernetes integrations and a keen focus on zero trust networking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform\">HashiCorp Terraform</a>:</strong> Builds reliable multi-cloud infrastructure and deploys complex workloads to Kubernetes using industry-standard <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code\">infrastructure as code</a> practices</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault\">HashiCorp Consul</a>:</strong> Discovers services and secure networks through identity-based authorization</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul\">HashiCorp Vault</a>:</strong> Protects sensitive data and delivers automated PKI at scale to achieve mTLS for authenticated SBI communications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HashiCorp Vault in particular presents an attractive solution for easily securing SBI flows with mTLS authentication. Vault is a distributed, highly available secrets management platform that can span multiple private and public cloud regions, accommodating a wide variety of SBA consumer personas and environments. Several replication options offer robust <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/why-replication-important-feature-vault\">disaster recovery features</a>, as well as increased performance through horizontal scaling.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667317934-vault-ha-architecture-2x-1.png\" alt=\"Vault\" high-availability architecture><p><em>Vault high-availability architecture</em></p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#certificate-lifecycle-automation-with-vault\" aria-label=\"certificate lifecycle automation with vault permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Certificate Lifecycle Automation with Vault</h2>\n<p>The PKI functionality of Vault (one of many <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-secrets-engines\">secret engines</a> available) is powerful, comprehensive, and <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials\">simple to implement</a>. Vault supports an arbitrary number of Certificate Authorities (CAs) and Intermediates, which can be generated internally or imported from external sources such as hardware security modules (HSMs). Fully automated cross-signing capabilities create additional options for managing 5G provider trust boundaries and network topologies.</p>\n<p>Access to Vault itself must be authenticated. Thankfully, this is a Kubernetes-friendly operation that permits straightforward integration options for container-based NF workloads. Supported authentication methods include all of the major public cloud machine-identity systems, a per-cluster native Kubernetes option, and JWT-based authentication that incorporates seamlessly with the OIDC provider built into Kubernetes. The JWT-based method is capable of scaling to support many clusters in parallel, utilizing the service account tokens that are projected to pods by default.</p>\n<p>Once successfully authenticated to Vault, a policy attached to the auth method dictates the client\u2019s ability to access secrets within an engine. These policies can be highly granular based on a number of parameters, such as the client\u2019s JWT token claims, Microsoft Azure Managed Identity, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> role, and more.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667318061-vault-auth-methods-2x.png\" alt=\"Vault\" logical flow from authentication to secret consumption><p><em>Vault logical flow from authentication to secret consumption</em></p>\n<p>If a policy grants access to a PKI secrets engine, the client may request a certificate specifying certain parameters in the API request payload, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common name</li>\n<li>Subject alternative names (SANs)</li>\n<li>IP SANs</li>\n<li>Expiry time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The allowed parameters of the request are constrained by a role object configured against the PKI engine, which outlines permitted domain names, maximum TTL, and additional enforcements for the associated certificate authority. An authenticated, authorized, and valid request results in the issuance of a certificate and private key, delivered back to the client in the form of a JSON payload, which can then be parsed and rendered to the pod filesystem as specified by the NF application\u2019s requirements and configuration.</p>\n<p>The processes described to authenticate and request certificates can be executed by API call from the primary container, an<code>init</code>container, or any of a number of custom solutions. To reduce the burden of developing unique strategies for each NF, organizations may instead choose to leverage the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector\">Vault Agent Injector for Kubernetes</a> to automate the distribution of certificates. This solution consists of a mutating admission controller that intercepts lifecycle events and modifies the pod spec to include a Vault Agent sidecar container. Once configured, standard pod annotations can be used by operations teams to manage the PKI lifecycle, ensuring that certificates and private keys are rendered to appropriate filesystem locations, and are renewed prior to expiry, without ever touching the NF application code.</p>\n<p>The agent is additionally capable of executing arbitrary commands or API calls upon certificate renewal, which can be configured to include reloading a service or restarting a pod. The injector provides a low-resistance path for service providers seeking to minimize the software development effort required to achieve mTLS compliance.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667318102-vault-jwt-auth-for-k8s-2x.png\" alt=\"Vault\" jwt auth method with kubernetes as oidc provider><p><em>Vault JWT Auth Method with Kubernetes as OIDC provider</em></p>\n<p>Vault also integrates with <a href=\"https://cert-manager.io/\">cert-manager</a>, which grants the ability to configure Vault as a ClusterIssuer in Kubernetes and subsequently deliver certificates to Ingresses and other cluster objects. This approach can be useful if the SBI in question specifies a TLS-terminating Ingress Controller.</p>\n<p>Software vendors building 5G NFs may alternatively decide to incorporate Vault into their existing middleware or configuration automation via a more centralized API integration. For example, a service may already be in place to distribute certificates to pods within the NF ecosystem that have interfaces on the SBI message bus. This solution might rely on a legacy certificate procurement protocol such as CMPv2. Replacing this mechanism with simple HTTP API calls to Vault would not only be a relatively trivial effort, it would be a shift very much in the spirit of the 3GPP inclination towards standard RESTful, HTTP-based communications, and broader industry trends.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#working-together-to-make-5g-more-secure\" aria-label=\"working together to make 5g more secure permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Working Together to Make 5G More Secure</h2>\n<p>HashiCorp accelerates <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/industries/telecom\">cloud transformation for Telcos</a> pursuing automation, operational maturity, and compliance for 5G networks.

While that\u2019s really convenient at times, it also results in large packages that compilers and language server protocols find taxing to handle. Not only that, but generating providers also takes longer for CDKTF. With the move to namespacing, the providers are divided into logical groups based on the kinds of constructs being exported. These numerous small packages are faster for the compiler to process than one large package, resulting in the significant speedups highlighted above.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#what-you-need-to-do\" aria-label=\"what you need to do permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>What You Need To Do</h2>\n<p>The introduction of namespaces means that the import paths for all of your provider-related classes will need to be updated. As an example, instead of:</p>\n<pre><code>import { AwsProvider, ec2 } from \"@cdktf/provider-aws\";\n\nclass MyStack extends TerraformStack {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {\n    super(scope, id);\n\n    new AwsProvider(this, \"AWS\", {\n      region: \"us-west-1\",\n    });\n\n    const instance = new ec2.Instance(this, \"compute\", {\n      ami: \"ami-01456a894f71116f2\",\n      instanceType: \"t2.micro\",\n    });\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>In CDKTF 0.13, you would write:</p>\n<pre><code>import { AwsProvider } from \"@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/provider\";\nimport { Instance } from \"@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/instance\";\n\nclass MyStack extends TerraformStack {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {\n    super(scope, id);\n\n    new AwsProvider(this, \"AWS\", {\n      region: \"us-west-1\",\n    });\n\n    const instance = new Instance(this, \"compute\", {\n      ami: \"ami-01456a894f71116f2\",\n      instanceType: \"t2.micro\",\n    });\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>For more upgrade information, check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/cdktf/release/upgrade-guide-v0-13\">Upgrading to CDK for Terraform Version 0.13</a>.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#when-do-you-need-to-update\" aria-label=\"when do you need to update permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>When Do You Need To Update?</h2>\n<p>If you're currently using CDKTF 0.12 and it's working well for you, you don't have to update to 0.13 right away. The <em>only</em> change introduced in 0.13 was the performance enhancement, so you're not missing out on any critical features.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to take advantage of the performance improvements in 0.13 but aren't ready to change the import paths for all of your existing providers, we have good news: we've made the 0.13 release backwards-compatible with 0.12 provider bindings. This allows you to have two versions of the same provider in your code (one locally generated and one <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/cdktf/concepts/providers#install-pre-built-providers\">pre-built</a>) and to mix namespaced and non-namespaced providers as you like. Our goal here is to reduce the disruption of this breaking change and give users more time to gradually migrate their code to the new syntax.</p>\n<p>Once you're ready to fully embrace our newly namespaced world in CDKTF 0.13, then you can go ahead and update your code as described in the \"What You Need To Do\" section above.</p>\n<p>No matter what, you will need to update your existing code to the new namespaced syntax in order to upgrade to CDKTF 0.14. We are only maintaining the backwards-compatible provider bindings for this one release, meaning the 0.12 (non-namespaced) provider bindings will no longer work with CDKTF 0.14 and above. We are currently targeting mid-November 2022 for the release of 0.14.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#what-s-next-for-cdktf\" aria-label=\"what s next for cdktf permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>What's Next for CDKTF</h2>\n<p>The CDKTF 0.14 release will focus primarily on quality-of-life improvements that make it easier to use <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/cdktf/concepts/providers#install-pre-built-providers\">pre-built providers</a>. One key discovery we made as we researched ways to improve performance was that pre-built providers give a vastly better developer experience than locally generating them using <code>cdktf get</code>, so we want to encourage users to take advantage of these as much as possible.</p>\n<p>In the coming months, we'll be looking to make more pre-built providers available as installable packages. Until then we'll be making improvements to the <code>cdktf provider add</code> command <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdk-terraform-0-11-introduces-new-provider-command\">introduced in CDKTF 0.11</a> and the <code>cdktf init</code> workflow to make it as easy as possible to find and add pre-built providers to your project.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#special-thanks-to-aws\" aria-label=\"special thanks to aws permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Special Thanks to AWS</h2>\n<p>We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the AWS CDK team, particularly Romain Marcadier, for working closely with us to explore all the options for improving the performance of code generation through <a href=\"https://aws.github.io/jsii/\">jsii</a> and helping us validate namespaces as our best path forward.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#try-cdk-for-terraform\" aria-label=\"try cdk for terraform permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Try CDK for Terraform</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re new to the project, these <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/cdktf\">tutorials for CDK for Terraform</a> are the best way to get started.
