While 2022 was a turbulent year for many in the tech industry, there was also much to celebrate. The year \u2014 our first after going public in 2021 \u2014 marked <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-celebrates-10-years\">HashiCorp\u2019s 10th anniversary (or Hashiversary, as we call it)</a>.

      "description": "The Terraform Plugin Framework 1.0 is now generally available to provide a modern and extensible way for developers to create Terraform providers.",
      "content": "\n<p>We are excited to share that Terraform Plugin Framework version 1.0.0 is now generally available (GA). The Terraform Plugin Framework is the successor to the Terraform Plugin SDKv2, and forms the basis for creating Terraform providers. Terraform relies on a type of plugin called a <em>provider</em> to interact with cloud resources, SaaS platforms, and other APIs. Providers are at the heart of Terraform\u2019s extensibility for multi-cloud provisioning, and the ecosystem now includes more than 2,700 public providers in the Terraform Registry.</p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll discuss why we changed the way Terraform providers are built and review the new features in the 1.0 release.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#a-new-way-to-build-terraform-providers\" aria-label=\"a new way to build terraform providers permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>A New Way to Build Terraform Providers</h2>\n<p>Providers are executable binaries written in Go that communicate with Terraform Core over an RPC interface. While Terraform providers have traditionally been developed using the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2\">Terraform Plugin SDKv2</a>, Terraform functionality and Go coding standards have evolved considerably over the years. To continue providing a great user experience for plugin development, we redesigned our provider authoring tools from the ground up using familiar, idiomatic patterns while prioritizing extensibility and concise abstractions. The result was our new Plugin Framework. The Plugin Framework\u2019s code is more maintainable and future-proof, and it will serve as the foundation for future Terraform plugin development features and tooling.</p>\n<p>Terraform Plugin SDKv2 technology will continue to exist alongside the Plugin Framework, but we recommend that provider developers adopt the new Plugin Framework to make use of the latest features. Going forward, new features and tooling will be prioritized for the Plugin Framework.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#what-s-new-in-terraform-plugin-framework-1-0\" aria-label=\"what s new in terraform plugin framework 1 0 permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>What\u2019s New in Terraform Plugin Framework 1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/validation\">Validators</a> give users feedback about required syntax, types, and acceptable values. The Plugin Framework offers a collection of pre-built validators that solve many common use cases, such as checking string lengths and numeric ranges.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/path-expressions\">Path expressions</a> provide additional flexibility when traversing resource or datasource schemas. For instance, the presence of an attribute within a Terraform configuration may be valid or not depending upon the presence of another attribute. A path expression allows the relationship between these attributes to be specified as a relative path.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/schemas#nested-attributes\">Nested attributes</a> allow schemas to be defined using objects of attributes that fully support attribute behaviors. Examples include required, optional, computed, plan modifiers, and validators.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/private-state\">Resource private state management</a> provides a way to store data alongside state but without exposing it to Terraform plans. It is generally for advanced use cases such as storing and retrieving values that do not need to be shown to users, such as ETags used within API calls.</li>\n<li>Custom types can be used for attributes within a schema where augmentation of a base type is required. For example, a custom type could be used to wrap a string and provide additional functionality such as the ability to parse and format the string as a timestamp.</li>\n<li>Plugin Framework-based providers can be made backward compatible with Terraform versions 0.12 and later. Provider developers can opt to use the newer <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/how-terraform-works#terraform-plugin-protocol\">Terraform Plugin Protocol</a> version 6 for access to the latest features in Terraform 1.x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#getting-started-with-the-terraform-plugin-framework\" aria-label=\"getting started with the terraform plugin framework permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Getting Started with the Terraform Plugin Framework</h2>\n<p>The tutorials available on the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework\">HashiCorp Developer</a> site are the best places to start if you are new to plugin development.

Cloud hosting providers began offering access to dynamic infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms. As these platforms grew and began offering more sophisticated infrastructure services, the complexity of a traditional systems administration role also grew. The need to rapidly configure and manage expanding cloud infrastructures quickly became a challenge.</p>\n<p>In 2011, AWS introduced CloudFormation, a service that helps model and set up AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run on AWS. With CloudFormation you could create a template that describes all the AWS resources you want to use (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS database instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You no longer have to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that for you.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#hashicorp-terraform-0-1\" aria-label=\"hashicorp terraform 0 1 permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>HashiCorp Terraform 0.1</h2>\n<p>Over time, though, a need grew for an environment-agnostic solution; a tool that could provide the same workflows, no matter what application you were using. The best, and maybe the only way to do this, was through the power of an open source ecosystem. In 2014, HashiCorp released <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-announcement\">Terraform 0.1</a>, an open source, cloud-agnostic <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code\">infrastructure as code</a> solution. Terraform 0.1 supported AWS resources at release. The idea was to start there and extend this automated provisioning workflow to any infrastructure simply by adding a new provider for that specific piece of infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#terraform-s-growth\" aria-label=\"terraform s growth permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Terraform\u2019s Growth</h2>\n<p>Terraform was far from an overnight success. Downloads were mostly stagnant for the first 18 months, and at one point shutting down the project <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/the-story-of-hashicorp-terraform-with-mitchell-hashimoto\">was considered</a>. The team at HashiCorp believed that Terraform would succeed primarily based on the ecosystem created around it; that is, the providers it would support. Building this ecosystem required an active and vibrant open source community. So Terraform was built to be easy to write and easy to use, and continued to iterate on the core workflow to ensure it solved real world problems.</p>\n<p>By the end of 2016 Terraform had more than 750 contributors. In 2017, HashiCorp launched the first provider program to help partners and communities build, post, and maintain providers. In that same year, the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/\">Terraform Registry</a> launched to enable partners and community to compose and share modules. Downloads began to double every month as new modules and providers were added.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#scaling-terraform\" aria-label=\"scaling terraform permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Scaling Terraform</h2>\n<p>From 2018 to 2020, HashiCorp began to put more focus on commercializing Terraform. This was an important step to ensure the open source project and the company behind it were sustainable. HashiCorp released Terraform Enterprise and Terraform Cloud and began adding large organizations as paying customers.

Today there are more than 2,500 Terraform providers and 10,000 modules. Terraform has achieved this success because of the community around it: the open source contributors, the ambassadors, our users, and our partners.</p>\n<p>As the community adopted Terraform for infrastructure as code, many large organizations also realized that Terraform had what they needed for successful infrastructure automation. As they scale, these organizations need a standardized approach to compose, reuse, and collaborate around infrastructure as code to provision infrastructure. Today, there are thousands of Terraform commercial customers. World class organizations are standardizing on Terraform Enterprise to help drive their digital transformations.

With CDK for Terraform, you can write Terraform configurations in your choice of C#, Python, TypeScript, Java, or Go, and still benefit from the full ecosystem of Terraform providers and modules.</p>\n<p>Auto-generating the code bindings for a large Terraform provider can take several minutes, so CDKTF offers pre-built provider packages that you can import directly into your application. Version 0.14 introduces several improvements that make pre-built providers easier to use, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>New <code>provider upgrade</code> command</strong>: Now you can upgrade installed provider bindings while respecting dependencies such as the CDKTF version.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Select pre-built providers when initializing a new project</strong>: The <code>cdktf init</code> command now lists all available pre-built providers when initializing a new project and allows you to directly install them when setting up a new CDKTF project.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>More pre-built providers</strong>: We now publish pre-built provider packages for all official Terraform providers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improvements to the <code>get</code> Command</strong>: Subsequent runs of <code>get</code> are faster now because existing bindings are not regenerated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Back in October, we <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/cdk-for-terraform-0-13-significantly-improves-performance\">announced significant performance improvements with CDKTF version 0.13</a>.

      "description": "As next-generation 5G begins to take shape, learn about a suite of comprehensive, identity-based security solutions for microservice environments.",
      "content": "\n<p>The introduction of 5G networking and its accompanying Service-Based Architecture (SBA) control plane brings a noteworthy shift: Instead of a traditional design consisting of proprietary signaling between physical, black-box components, SBA uses a commodity-like, microservice implementation that is increasingly cloud native, relying on standard RESTful APIs to communicate. This requires a reset in how carriers implement security, one where proven cloud concepts will likely play a significant role.</p>\n<p>This post will show how the HashiCorp suite of products, especially HashiCorp Vault\u2019s PKI functionality, are well suited for SBAs and cater to a variety of 5G core use cases, with tight Kubernetes integrations and a focus on zero trust networking. These tools provide a strong foundation for 5G environments because many of the constructs included in SBA resemble a modern, <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/introduction-to-zero-trust-security\">zero trust</a> <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/concepts/service-mesh\">service mesh</a>. Vault in particular offers full PKI management and a low-resistance path for service providers seeking to minimize the software development effort required to achieve mTLS compliance.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#the-new-face-of-telecom-networking\" aria-label=\"the new face of telecom networking permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>The New Face of Telecom Networking</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.3gpp.org/\">3GPP standards body</a> mandates a 5G mobile packet core based on discrete software components known as Network Functions (NF). The specifications clearly articulate requirements for NF communication pathways (known as reference points), protocols, service-based interfaces (SBI), and critically, how these network channels are secured.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667317460-5g-sba.png\" alt=\"SBI\" representation of a service-based architecture><p><em>SBI representation of a 5G service-based architecture</em></p>\n<p>Orchestration platforms have opened up powerful integration, scaling, and locality opportunities for hosting and managing these NFs that were not possible in earlier manifestations of cellular technology. A mature 5G core could span multiple datacenters and public cloud regions, and scale to thousands of worker nodes.</p>\n<p>An entire Kubernetes cluster, for example, may be dedicated to the requirements of a single NF: internally, a function may consist of many pods, deployments, services, and other Kubernetes constructs. The SBI itself could be any network interface associated with an NF that is attached to the control plane network for the purpose of consuming and/or providing a service in accordance with the specification.</p>\n<p>The 5G SBA also brings new security challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#securing-network-function-communication\" aria-label=\"securing network function communication permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Securing Network Function Communication</h2>\n<p><em>Security architecture and procedures for 5G System\n(<a href=\"https://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/33501.htm\">3GPP TS 33.501</a>)</em> is the document of record that details various security-related requirements within 5G SBA. Section 13.1.0 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All network functions shall support mutually authenticated TLS and HTTPS as specified in RFC 7540 [47] and RFC 2818 [90]. The identities in the end entity certificates shall be used for authentication and policy checks. Network functions shall support both server-side and client-side certificates. TLS client and server certificates shall be compliant with the SBA certificate profile specified in clause 6.1.3c of TS 33.310 [5].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>mTLS is a fundamental requirement within the 5G SBA for securing SBI flows at the authentication level. But what about authorization?</p>\n<p>One NF in particular is especially crucial in the context of security: the Network Repository Function (NRF) is responsible for dynamically registering all SBA components as they come online, acting as a kind of service discovery mechanism that can be queried in order to locate healthy services. In addition, the NRF has universal awareness of which functions should be permitted to freely communicate, issuing appropriately scoped OAuth2 tokens to each entity. These tokens authorize network flows between NFs, further securing the fabric.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667318319-nf-service-consumer-producer-edited.png\" alt=\"NF\" authentication and authorization flow><p><em>NF authentication and authorization flow</em></p>\n<p>There are two modes of service-to-service communication described in the <a href=\"https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs\">3GPP specifications</a>. In the Direct Communication mode, NFs engage in service discovery and inter-function network operations as explained above. However, in the Indirect Communication mode, a Service Control Proxy (SCP) may optionally intercept flows and even broker discovery requests with the NRF on behalf of a consumer. Various SCP implementations can augment SBA service networking by introducing intelligent load balancing and failover, policy-based controls, and monitoring.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#if-it-looks-like-a-mesh-walks-like-a-mesh\" aria-label=\"if it looks like a mesh walks like a mesh permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>If it Looks Like a Mesh, Walks Like a Mesh\u2026</h2>\n<p>To summarize, the 5G SBA includes a number of broad technology constructs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microservice architecture based on Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Hybrid-cloud/multi-cloud capabilities</li>\n<li>Service discovery and load balancing</li>\n<li>Network authentication via mTLS</li>\n<li>OAuth2 token-based authorization</li>\n<li>Optional proxy-based mode (policy and telemetry)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this is starting to sound familiar, you\u2019re not alone. While the indirect communication mode is optional (and does not specify a sidecar proxy), these elements combined closely resemble a modern, zero trust service mesh. Intentional or not, this emergent pattern could evolve towards the same architectural trends, platforms, and abstractions being adopted elsewhere in modern software.</p>\n<p>To that end, HashiCorp\u2018s enterprise products cater to a variety of core 5G use cases, with tight Kubernetes integrations and a keen focus on zero trust networking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform\">HashiCorp Terraform</a>:</strong> Builds reliable multi-cloud infrastructure and deploys complex workloads to Kubernetes using industry-standard <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code\">infrastructure as code</a> practices</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault\">HashiCorp Consul</a>:</strong> Discovers services and secure networks through identity-based authorization</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul\">HashiCorp Vault</a>:</strong> Protects sensitive data and delivers automated PKI at scale to achieve mTLS for authenticated SBI communications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HashiCorp Vault in particular presents an attractive solution for easily securing SBI flows with mTLS authentication. Vault is a distributed, highly available secrets management platform that can span multiple private and public cloud regions, accommodating a wide variety of SBA consumer personas and environments. Several replication options offer robust <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/why-replication-important-feature-vault\">disaster recovery features</a>, as well as increased performance through horizontal scaling.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667317934-vault-ha-architecture-2x-1.png\" alt=\"Vault\" high-availability architecture><p><em>Vault high-availability architecture</em></p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#certificate-lifecycle-automation-with-vault\" aria-label=\"certificate lifecycle automation with vault permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Certificate Lifecycle Automation with Vault</h2>\n<p>The PKI functionality of Vault (one of many <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-secrets-engines\">secret engines</a> available) is powerful, comprehensive, and <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials\">simple to implement</a>. Vault supports an arbitrary number of Certificate Authorities (CAs) and Intermediates, which can be generated internally or imported from external sources such as hardware security modules (HSMs). Fully automated cross-signing capabilities create additional options for managing 5G provider trust boundaries and network topologies.</p>\n<p>Access to Vault itself must be authenticated. Thankfully, this is a Kubernetes-friendly operation that permits straightforward integration options for container-based NF workloads. Supported authentication methods include all of the major public cloud machine-identity systems, a per-cluster native Kubernetes option, and JWT-based authentication that incorporates seamlessly with the OIDC provider built into Kubernetes. The JWT-based method is capable of scaling to support many clusters in parallel, utilizing the service account tokens that are projected to pods by default.</p>\n<p>Once successfully authenticated to Vault, a policy attached to the auth method dictates the client\u2019s ability to access secrets within an engine. These policies can be highly granular based on a number of parameters, such as the client\u2019s JWT token claims, Microsoft Azure Managed Identity, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> role, and more.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667318061-vault-auth-methods-2x.png\" alt=\"Vault\" logical flow from authentication to secret consumption><p><em>Vault logical flow from authentication to secret consumption</em></p>\n<p>If a policy grants access to a PKI secrets engine, the client may request a certificate specifying certain parameters in the API request payload, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common name</li>\n<li>Subject alternative names (SANs)</li>\n<li>IP SANs</li>\n<li>Expiry time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The allowed parameters of the request are constrained by a role object configured against the PKI engine, which outlines permitted domain names, maximum TTL, and additional enforcements for the associated certificate authority. An authenticated, authorized, and valid request results in the issuance of a certificate and private key, delivered back to the client in the form of a JSON payload, which can then be parsed and rendered to the pod filesystem as specified by the NF application\u2019s requirements and configuration.</p>\n<p>The processes described to authenticate and request certificates can be executed by API call from the primary container, an<code>init</code>container, or any of a number of custom solutions. To reduce the burden of developing unique strategies for each NF, organizations may instead choose to leverage the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector\">Vault Agent Injector for Kubernetes</a> to automate the distribution of certificates. This solution consists of a mutating admission controller that intercepts lifecycle events and modifies the pod spec to include a Vault Agent sidecar container. Once configured, standard pod annotations can be used by operations teams to manage the PKI lifecycle, ensuring that certificates and private keys are rendered to appropriate filesystem locations, and are renewed prior to expiry, without ever touching the NF application code.</p>\n<p>The agent is additionally capable of executing arbitrary commands or API calls upon certificate renewal, which can be configured to include reloading a service or restarting a pod. The injector provides a low-resistance path for service providers seeking to minimize the software development effort required to achieve mTLS compliance.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1667318102-vault-jwt-auth-for-k8s-2x.png\" alt=\"Vault\" jwt auth method with kubernetes as oidc provider><p><em>Vault JWT Auth Method with Kubernetes as OIDC provider</em></p>\n<p>Vault also integrates with <a href=\"https://cert-manager.io/\">cert-manager</a>, which grants the ability to configure Vault as a ClusterIssuer in Kubernetes and subsequently deliver certificates to Ingresses and other cluster objects. This approach can be useful if the SBI in question specifies a TLS-terminating Ingress Controller.</p>\n<p>Software vendors building 5G NFs may alternatively decide to incorporate Vault into their existing middleware or configuration automation via a more centralized API integration. For example, a service may already be in place to distribute certificates to pods within the NF ecosystem that have interfaces on the SBI message bus. This solution might rely on a legacy certificate procurement protocol such as CMPv2. Replacing this mechanism with simple HTTP API calls to Vault would not only be a relatively trivial effort, it would be a shift very much in the spirit of the 3GPP inclination towards standard RESTful, HTTP-based communications, and broader industry trends.</p>\n<h2>\n<a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"https://hashicorp.com/blog/products/terraform#working-together-to-make-5g-more-secure\" aria-label=\"working together to make 5g more secure permalink\">\u00bb</a><a class=\"__target-h\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Working Together to Make 5G More Secure</h2>\n<p>HashiCorp accelerates <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/industries/telecom\">cloud transformation for Telcos</a> pursuing automation, operational maturity, and compliance for 5G networks.
