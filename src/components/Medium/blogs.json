The Use cases for them are enormous: from blocking known DoS sources to forward traffic from specific IP addresses on low latency\u00a0links.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take for instance the following logs generated by the SSH daemon in a linux\u00a0host.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/6a8bdd451748be2a7326a77029a6a200/href\">https://medium.com/media/6a8bdd451748be2a7326a77029a6a200/href</a><p>Won\u2019t it be great to have a way to share the IP addresses used by the user <em>xhoms</em> with the NGFW so specific security policies are applied to traffic sourced by that address just because we now know the endpoint is being managed by that\u00a0user?</p>\n<p>The following Shell CGI script could be used to create an External Dynamic List (EDL) that would list all known IP addresses the account <em>xhoms</em> was used to login into this\u00a0server.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/ec08fd38c48c8a005909d5b502e521cc/href\">https://medium.com/media/ec08fd38c48c8a005909d5b502e521cc/href</a><p>That is great\u00a0but:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When would addresses be removed from the list? At the daily log\u00a0rollout?</li>\n<li>Are all listed IP addresses still being operated by the user\u00a0<em>xhoms</em>?</li>\n<li>Is there any way to remove addresses from the list at user\u00a0logout?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To overcome these (and many other) limitations Palo Alto Networks NGFW feature a very powerful IP tagging API called User-ID. Although EDL and User-ID cover similar objectives there are fundamental technical differences between\u00a0them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User-ID is \u201casynchronous\u201d (push mode), supports bot \u201cset\u201d and \u201cdelete\u201d operations and provides a very flexible way to create groupings. Either by tagging address objects (Dynamic Address Group\u200a\u2014\u200aDAG ) or by mapping users to addresses and then tagging these users (Dynamic User Group\u200a\u2014\u200aDUG). User-ID allows for these tags to have a timeout in order for the PAN-OS device to take care of removing them at their due\u00a0time.</li>\n<li>EDL is \u201cuniversal\u201d. Almost all network appliance vendors provide a feature to fetch an IP address list from a\u00a0URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Years ago it was up to the end customer to create its own connectors. Just like the CGI script we shared before. But as presence of PAN-OS powered NGFW\u2019s grown among enterprise customers more application vendors decided to leverage the User-ID value by providing API clients out-of-the-box. Although this is great (for Palo Alto Network customers) losing the option to fetch a list from a URL (EDL mode) makes it more difficult to integrate legacy technologies that might be out there still in the\u00a0network.</p>\n<h4>Creating EDL\u2019s from User-ID enabled applications</h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume you have an application that features a PAN-OS User-ID API client and that is capable of pushing log entries to the PAN-OS NGFW in an asynchronous way. Let\u2019s assume, as well, that there are still some legacy network devices in your network that need to fetch that address metadata from a URL. How difficult it would be to create a micro-service for\u00a0that?</p>\n<p>One option would be to leverage a PAN-OS XML SDK like <a href=\"https://panos.pan.dev/docs/apis/panpython_qs\">PAN Python</a> or <a href=\"https://panos.pan.dev/docs/apis/pango_qs\">PAN GO</a> and to create a REST API that extracts the current state from the PAN-OS device using its operations API.</p>\n<pre>GET https://&lt;pan-os-device&gt;/api<br>    ?key=&lt;API-KEY&gt;<br>    &amp;type=op<br>    &amp;cmd=&lt;show&gt;&lt;object&gt;&lt;registered-ip&gt;&lt;all&gt;&lt;/all&gt;&lt;/registered-ip&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/show&gt;</pre>\n<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>\n<pre>&lt;response status=\"success\"&gt;<br>  &lt;result&gt;<br>    &lt;entry ip=\"10.10.10.11\" from_agent=\"0\" persistent=\"1\"&gt;<br>      &lt;tag&gt;<br>        &lt;member&gt;tag10&lt;/member&gt;<br>      &lt;/tag&gt;<br>    &lt;/entry&gt;<br>    &lt;entry ip=\"10.10.10.10\" from_agent=\"0\" persistent=\"1\"&gt;<br>      &lt;tag&gt;<br>        &lt;member&gt;tag10&lt;/member&gt;<br>      &lt;/tag&gt;<br>    &lt;/entry&gt;<br>    &lt;count&gt;2&lt;/count&gt;<br>  &lt;/result&gt;<br>&lt;/response&gt;</pre>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to parse the response and provide a plain list out of it, right? Come back to me if you\u2019re thinking on using a XSLT processor to pipe it at the output of a cURL command packing everything as a CGI script because we might have some common grounds\u00a0;-)</p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to propose a different approach though: to hijack User-ID messages by implementing a micro-service that behaves as a <strong>reverse proxy</strong> between the application that features the User-ID client and the PAN-OS device. I like this approach because it opens the door to other interesting use cases like enforcing timeout (adding timeout to entries that do not have it), converting DAG messages into DUG equivalents or adding additional tags based on the source application.</p>\n<h4>Components for a User-ID to EDL reverse\u00a0proxy</h4>\n<p>The ingredients for such a receipt would\u00a0be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a light http web server featuring routing (hijack messages sent to /api and let other requests pass through). GO <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/net/http\">http package</a> and the type <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil@go1.16.2#ReverseProxy\">ReverseType</a> fits like a glove in this\u00a0case.</li>\n<li>a collection of XML-enabled GO structs to unmarshal captured User-ID messages.</li>\n<li>a library featuring User-ID message payload processing capable of keeping a valid (non-expired) state of User-to-IP, Group-to-IP and Tag-to-IP maps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fortunately for us there is the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xhoms/panoslib\">xhoms/panoslib</a> GO module that covers 2 and 3 (OK, let\u2019s be honest, I purpose-built the library to support this\u00a0article)</p>\n<p>With all these components it won\u2019t be that difficult to reverse proxy a PAN-OS https service monitoring User-ID messages and exposing the state of the corresponding entries on a virtual endpoint named /edl that won\u2019t conflict at all with the PAN-OS\u00a0schema.</p>\n<p>I wanted to prove the point and ended up coding the receipt as a micro-service.

Configuration parameters would be provided to the container as environment variables.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implementation details ended up shared in a document available in <a href=\"https://cortex.pan.dev/docs/tutorials/xdr_alert_ingestion\">cortex.pan.dev</a>. If you\u2019re in the mood of creating your own implementation I highly recommend you taking the time to go over the whole tutorial. If you just want to get to the point then you can use this <a href=\"https://github.com/users/xhoms/packages/container/package/xdrgateway\">ready-to-go container image</a>.</p>\n<h3>Let\u2019s get\u00a0started</h3>\n<p>I opted for using the available container image. Let me guide you through my experience using it to fulfil my customer\u2019s request.</p>\n<p>First of all the application requires some configuration data that must be provided as a set of environmental variables. A few of them are mandatory, others are just optional with default\u00a0values.</p>\n<p>The following are the required variables (the application will refuse to start without\u00a0them)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API_KEY:<strong> </strong>XDR API Key (Advanced)</li>\n<li>API_KEY_ID:<strong> </strong>The XDR API Key identifier (its sequence\u00a0number)</li>\n<li>FQDN:<strong> </strong>Fully Qualified Domain Name of the corresponding XDR Instance (i.e. myxdr.xdr.us.paloaltonetworks.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following are optional variables</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PSK: the server will check the value in the Authorization header to accept the request (default to no authentication)</li>\n<li>DEBUG: if it exists then the engine will be more verbose (defaults to\u00a0false)</li>\n<li>PORT: TCP port to bind the HTTP server to (defaults to\u00a08080)</li>\n<li>OFFSET: PAN-OS timestamp does not include time zone. By default, they will be considered in UTC (defaults to +0\u00a0hours)</li>\n<li>QUOTA_SIZE: XDR ingestion alert quota (defaults to\u00a0600)</li>\n<li>QUOTA_SECONDS: XDR ingestion alert quota refresh period (defaults to 60\u00a0seconds)</li>\n<li>UPDATE_SIZE: XDR ingestion alert max number of alerts per update (defaults to\u00a060)</li>\n<li>BUFFER_SIZE: size of the pipe buffer (defaults to 6000 = 10\u00a0minutes)</li>\n<li>T1: how often the pipe buffer polled for new alerts (defaults to 2\u00a0seconds)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details, you can check public repository <a href=\"https://github.com/xhoms/xdrgateway\">documentation</a></p>\n<h4>Step 1: <strong>Generate an Advanced API key on Cortex\u00a0XDR</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>Connect to your Cortex XDR instance and navigate to Setting &gt; API Keys Generate an API Key of type Advanced granting the Administrator role to it (that role is required for Alert ingestion)</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*l6_ws7RtoivHjme5\"></figure><h4><strong>Step 2: Run the container image</strong></h4>\n<p>Assuming you have Docker installed on your computer the following command line command would pull the image and run the micro-service with configuration options passed as environmental variables.</p>\n<pre>docker run -rm -p 8080:8080 -e PSK=hello -e FQDN=xxx.xdr.us.paloaltonetworks.com -e API_KEY=&lt;my-api-key&gt; -e API_KEY_ID=&lt;my-key-id&gt; -e DEBUG=yes ghcr.io/xhoms/xdrgateway</pre>\n<p>The Debug option provides more verbosity and it is recommended for initial experimentation. If everything goes as expected you\u2019ll see a log message like the following one.</p>\n<pre>2021/03/17 21:32:25 starting http service on port 8080</pre>\n<h4>Step 3: Perform a quick test to verify the micro-service is\u00a0running</h4>\n<p>Use any API test tool (I like good-old Curl) to push a test\u00a0payload.</p>\n<pre>curl -X POST -H \"Authorization: hello\" \"<a href=\"http://rancher:8081/in\">http://127.0.0.1:8080/in</a>\" -d '{\"src\":\"1.2.3.4\",\"sport\":1234,\"dst\":\"4.3.2.1\",\"dport\": 4231,\"time_generated\":\"2021/01/06 20:44:34\",\"rule\":\"test_rule\",\"serial\":\"9999\",\"sender_sw_version\":\"10.0.4\",\"subtype\":\"spyware\",\"threat_name\":\"bad-bad-c2c\",\"severity\":\"critical\",\"action\":\"alert\"}---annex---\"Mozi Command and Control Traffic Detection\"'</pre>\n<p>You should receive an empty status 200 response and see log messages in the server console like the following ones:</p>\n<pre>2021/03/17 21:52:16 api - successfully parsed alert<br>2021/03/17 21:52:17 xdrclient - successful call to insert_parsed_alerts</pre>\n<h4><strong>Step 4: Configure HTTP log Forward on the Firewall:</strong></h4>\n<p>PAN-OS NGFW can forward alerts to HTTP/S endpoints. The feature configuration is available in Device &gt; Server Profiles &gt; HTTP and, for this case, you should use the following parameters</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP\u00a0: IP address of the container host</li>\n<li>Protocol\u00a0:\u00a0HTTP</li>\n<li>Port: 8080(default)</li>\n<li>HTTP Method\u00a0POST</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ikHuhU9BUhhzBjZP\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/847/1*6kZ_SHkUIcW6vsH_LMml0Q.png\"></figure><p>Some notes regarding the payload\u00a0format</p>\n<ul>\n<li>URI Format:\u201c/in\u201d is the endpoint where the micro-service listen for POST requests containing new\u00a0alerts</li>\n<li>Headers: Notice we\u2019re setting the value hello in the Authorization header to match the -e PSK=hello configuration variable we passed to the micro-service</li>\n<li>Payload: The variable $threat_name was introduced with PAN-OS 10.0. If you\u2019re using older versions of PAN-OS the you can use the variable $threatid instead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last action to complete this job is to create a new Log Forwarding profile that will consume our recently created HTTP server and to use it in all security rules we want their alerts being ingested into XDR. The configuration object is available at Objects &gt; Log Forwarding</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9ZrWMDpMosw9baso\"></figure><h4>Step 5: Final\u00a0checks</h4>\n<p>As your PAN-OS NGFW starts generating alerts, you should see activity in the micro-service\u2019s output log and alerts being ingested into the Cortex XDR instance. The source tag Palo Alto Networks\u200a\u2014\u200aPAN-OS clearly indicates these alerts were pushed by our deployment.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LntWo1GBlfTHKCYWG1afEA.png\"></figure><h3>Production-ready version</h3>\n<p>There a couple of additional steps to perform before considering the micro-service production-ready.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The service should be exposed over a secure channel (TLS). Best option is to leverage the preferred forward-proxy environment available in our container environment. Notice the image honours the PORT env variable and should work out-of-the-box almost everywhere</li>\n<li>A restart-policy should be in place to restart the container in case of a crash. It is not a good idea to run more than one instance in a load balancing group because the quota enforcement won\u2019t be synchronised between\u00a0them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Palo Alto Networks products and services are built with automation and customisation in mind. They feature rich API\u2019s that can be used to tailor them to specific customer\u00a0needs.</p>\n<p>In my case these APIs provided the customer with a\u00a0choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either wait for the scope of the project (and its budget) to increase in order to accommodate additional products like Cortex <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/network-traffic-analysis\">Network Traffic Analysis</a>\u00a0<strong>or</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Deploy a compact \u201cmiddle-man\u201d that would connect the PAN-OS and Cortex XDR\u00a0API\u2019s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This experience empowered me by acquiring DevOps knowledge (building micro-services) I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll use in many opportunities to come. Special thanks to The Developer Relations team at Palo Alto Networks who provided documentation and examples, and were eager to explore this new use case.

A few of them are mandatory, others are just optional with default\u00a0values.</p>\n<p>The following are the required variables (the application will refuse to start without\u00a0them)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API_KEY:<strong> </strong>XDR API Key (Advanced)</li>\n<li>API_KEY_ID:<strong> </strong>The XDR API Key identifier (its sequence\u00a0number)</li>\n<li>FQDN:<strong> </strong>Fully Qualified Domain Name of the corresponding XDR Instance (i.e. myxdr.xdr.us.paloaltonetworks.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following are optional variables</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PSK: the server will check the value in the Authorization header to accept the request (default to no authentication)</li>\n<li>DEBUG: if it exists then the engine will be more verbose (defaults to\u00a0false)</li>\n<li>PORT: TCP port to bind the HTTP server to (defaults to\u00a08080)</li>\n<li>OFFSET: PAN-OS timestamp does not include time zone. By default, they will be considered in UTC (defaults to +0\u00a0hours)</li>\n<li>QUOTA_SIZE: XDR ingestion alert quota (defaults to\u00a0600)</li>\n<li>QUOTA_SECONDS: XDR ingestion alert quota refresh period (defaults to 60\u00a0seconds)</li>\n<li>UPDATE_SIZE: XDR ingestion alert max number of alerts per update (defaults to\u00a060)</li>\n<li>BUFFER_SIZE: size of the pipe buffer (defaults to 6000 = 10\u00a0minutes)</li>\n<li>T1: how often the pipe buffer polled for new alerts (defaults to 2\u00a0seconds)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details, you can check public repository <a href=\"https://github.com/xhoms/xdrgateway\">documentation</a></p>\n<h4>Step 1: <strong>Generate an Advanced API key on Cortex\u00a0XDR</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>Connect to your Cortex XDR instance and navigate to Setting &gt; API Keys Generate an API Key of type Advanced granting the Administrator role to it (that role is required for Alert ingestion)</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*l6_ws7RtoivHjme5\"></figure><h4><strong>Step 2: Run the container image</strong></h4>\n<p>Assuming you have Docker installed on your computer the following command line command would pull the image and run the micro-service with configuration options passed as environmental variables.</p>\n<pre>docker run -rm -p 8080:8080 -e PSK=hello -e FQDN=xxx.xdr.us.paloaltonetworks.com -e API_KEY=&lt;my-api-key&gt; -e API_KEY_ID=&lt;my-key-id&gt; -e DEBUG=yes ghcr.io/xhoms/xdrgateway</pre>\n<p>The Debug option provides more verbosity and it is recommended for initial experimentation. If everything goes as expected you\u2019ll see a log message like the following one.</p>\n<pre>2021/03/17 21:32:25 starting http service on port 8080</pre>\n<h4>Step 3: Perform a quick test to verify the micro-service is\u00a0running</h4>\n<p>Use any API test tool (I like good-old Curl) to push a test\u00a0payload.</p>\n<pre>curl -X POST -H \"Authorization: hello\" \"<a href=\"http://rancher:8081/in\">http://127.0.0.1:8080/in</a>\" -d '{\"src\":\"1.2.3.4\",\"sport\":1234,\"dst\":\"4.3.2.1\",\"dport\": 4231,\"time_generated\":\"2021/01/06 20:44:34\",\"rule\":\"test_rule\",\"serial\":\"9999\",\"sender_sw_version\":\"10.0.4\",\"subtype\":\"spyware\",\"threat_name\":\"bad-bad-c2c\",\"severity\":\"critical\",\"action\":\"alert\"}---annex---\"Mozi Command and Control Traffic Detection\"'</pre>\n<p>You should receive an empty status 200 response and see log messages in the server console like the following ones:</p>\n<pre>2021/03/17 21:52:16 api - successfully parsed alert<br>2021/03/17 21:52:17 xdrclient - successful call to insert_parsed_alerts</pre>\n<h4><strong>Step 4: Configure HTTP log Forward on the Firewall:</strong></h4>\n<p>PAN-OS NGFW can forward alerts to HTTP/S endpoints. The feature configuration is available in Device &gt; Server Profiles &gt; HTTP and, for this case, you should use the following parameters</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP\u00a0: IP address of the container host</li>\n<li>Protocol\u00a0:\u00a0HTTP</li>\n<li>Port: 8080(default)</li>\n<li>HTTP Method\u00a0POST</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ikHuhU9BUhhzBjZP\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/847/1*6kZ_SHkUIcW6vsH_LMml0Q.png\"></figure><p>Some notes regarding the payload\u00a0format</p>\n<ul>\n<li>URI Format:\u201c/in\u201d is the endpoint where the micro-service listen for POST requests containing new\u00a0alerts</li>\n<li>Headers: Notice we\u2019re setting the value hello in the Authorization header to match the -e PSK=hello configuration variable we passed to the micro-service</li>\n<li>Payload: The variable $threat_name was introduced with PAN-OS 10.0. If you\u2019re using older versions of PAN-OS the you can use the variable $threatid instead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last action to complete this job is to create a new Log Forwarding profile that will consume our recently created HTTP server and to use it in all security rules we want their alerts being ingested into XDR. The configuration object is available at Objects &gt; Log Forwarding</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9ZrWMDpMosw9baso\"></figure><h4>Step 5: Final\u00a0checks</h4>\n<p>As your PAN-OS NGFW starts generating alerts, you should see activity in the micro-service\u2019s output log and alerts being ingested into the Cortex XDR instance. The source tag Palo Alto Networks\u200a\u2014\u200aPAN-OS clearly indicates these alerts were pushed by our deployment.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LntWo1GBlfTHKCYWG1afEA.png\"></figure><h3>Production-ready version</h3>\n<p>There a couple of additional steps to perform before considering the micro-service production-ready.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The service should be exposed over a secure channel (TLS). Best option is to leverage the preferred forward-proxy environment available in our container environment. Notice the image honours the PORT env variable and should work out-of-the-box almost everywhere</li>\n<li>A restart-policy should be in place to restart the container in case of a crash. It is not a good idea to run more than one instance in a load balancing group because the quota enforcement won\u2019t be synchronised between\u00a0them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Palo Alto Networks products and services are built with automation and customisation in mind. They feature rich API\u2019s that can be used to tailor them to specific customer\u00a0needs.</p>\n<p>In my case these APIs provided the customer with a\u00a0choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either wait for the scope of the project (and its budget) to increase in order to accommodate additional products like Cortex <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/network-traffic-analysis\">Network Traffic Analysis</a>\u00a0<strong>or</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Deploy a compact \u201cmiddle-man\u201d that would connect the PAN-OS and Cortex XDR\u00a0API\u2019s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This experience empowered me by acquiring DevOps knowledge (building micro-services) I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll use in many opportunities to come. Special thanks to The Developer Relations team at Palo Alto Networks who provided documentation and examples, and were eager to explore this new use case. I couldn\u2019t have done it without their help and the work they\u2019ve been putting into improving our developer experience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8eef3e59b264\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/ingest-pan-os-alerts-into-cortex-xdr-pro-endpoint-8eef3e59b264\">Ingest PAN-OS Alerts into Cortex XDR Pro Endpoint</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog\">Palo Alto Networks Developer Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["cortex-xdr","containers","pan-os-alerts","api","ingestion"]},{"title":"Enterprise API design practices: Part 4","pubDate":"2021-02-23 10:10:38","link":"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-4-b94d9e8532f5?source=rss----7f77455ad9a7---4","guid":"https://medium.com/p/b94d9e8532f5","author":"Francesco Vigo","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SmWJPvCF1Y5OMz_Wvxe5Vg.jpeg","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SmWJPvCF1Y5OMz_Wvxe5Vg.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dallimonti?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Andr\u00e9s Dallimonti</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cockpit?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to the last part of my series on creating <strong>valuable</strong>, <strong>usable </strong>and <strong>future-proof </strong>Enterprise APIs. I <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-1-1c5a47717ed0\">initially</a> covered some background context and the importance of design, <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724\">then</a> I presented security and backend protection and in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-3-c56c3091c7d\">third chapter</a> I explored optimizations and scale; this post is about monitoring and Developer Experience (DX).</p>\n<h3>5. Monitor your\u00a0APIs</h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t fly blind: you must make sure that your APIs are properly instrumented so you can monitor what\u2019s going on. This is important for a lot of good reasons, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Security: </strong>is your service under attack or being used maliciously? You should always be able to figure out if there are anomalies and react swiftly to prevent incidents.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Auditing</strong>: depending on the nature of your business, you might be required by compliance or investigative reasons to produce an audit trail of user activity of your product, which requires proper instrumentation of your APIs as well as logging\u00a0events.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance and scale</strong>: you should be aware of how your API and backend are performing and if the key metrics are within the acceptable ranges, way before your users start complaining and your business is impacted. It\u2019s always better to optimize before performance becomes a real\u00a0problem.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cost:</strong> similarly, with proper instrumentation, you can be aware of your infrastructure costs sustained to serve a certain amount of traffic. That can help you with capacity planning and cost modeling if you\u2019re monetizing your service. And to avoid unexpected bills at the end of the month that might force you to disrupt the\u00a0service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feedback</strong>: with proper telemetry data to look at when you deploy a change, you can understand how it\u2019s performing and whether it was a good idea to implement it. It also allows you to implement prototyping techniques such as A/B\u00a0testing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Learn</strong>: analyzing how developers use your API can be a great source of learning. It will give you useful insights on how your service is being consumed and is a valuable source of ideas that you can evaluate for new features (i.e. new use-case driven API endpoints).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proper instrumentation of services is a vast topic and here I just want to summarize a few items that are usually easy to implement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every API request should have a unique operation identifier that is stored in your logs and can help your ops team figure out what happened. This identifier should also be reported back to clients somewhere (usually in API response the headers) especially, but not exclusively, in case of\u00a0errors.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye on API requests that fail with server errors (i.e. the HTTP 5xx ones) and, if the number is non-negligible, try to pinpoint the root cause: is it a bug, or some request that is causing timeouts in the backend? Can you fix it or make it\u00a0faster?</li>\n<li>Keep a reasonable log history to allow tracking errors and auditing user activity for at least several days back in\u00a0time.</li>\n<li>Create dashboards that help you monitor user activity, API usage, security metrics, etc. And make sure to <strong>check them\u00a0often</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6. Make Developer Experience a\u00a0priority</h3>\n<p>Last principle, but definitely not the least important. Even if you are lucky and the developers that use your APIs are required to do so because of an external mandate, you shouldn\u2019t make their experience less positive.</p>\n<blockquote>In fact, the Developer Experience of your product should be\u00a0awesome.</blockquote>\n<p>If developers properly understand how to work with your APIs, and enjoy doing so, they will likely run into fewer issues and be more patient when trying to overcome them. They will also provide you with good quality feedback. It will reduce the number of requests they generate on your support teams. They will give you insights and use case ideas for building a better\u00a0product.</p>\n<blockquote>And, more importantly, happy developers will ultimately build better products for their own customers which, in turn, will act as a force multiplier for the value and success of your own product. Everybody wins in the API Economy model: customers, business stakeholders, partners, product teams, engineers, support\u00a0teams.</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve witnessed several situations where developers were so exhausted and frustrated with working against a bad API that, as soon as they saw the light at the end of the tunnel, they stopped thinking creatively and just powered their way through to an MVP that was far from viable and valuable. But it checked the box they needed so they were allowed to move on. I consider this a very specific scenario of <em>developer fatigue</em>: let\u2019s call it \u201c<strong>API Fatigue</strong>\u201d.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I\u2019ve also experienced the other way around, where new, unplanned, great features were added because the DX was good and we had fun integrating things together.</p>\n<p>There are many resources out there that describe how to make APIs with great developer experience: the most obvious one is to create APIs that are clear and simple to consume. Apply the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment\">Principle of least astonishment</a>.</p>\n<p>I recommend considering the following when shipping an\u00a0API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Document your API properly</strong>: it\u2019s almost certain that the time you spend creating proper documentation at the beginning is saved later on when developers start consuming it. Specification files, such as <a href=\"https://swagger.io/specification/\">OpenAPI Specification</a> (OAS) tremendously help here. Also, if you follow the design-first approach that we discussed in the first post of this series, you\u2019ll probably already have a specification file ready to\u00a0use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Support different learning paths</strong>: some developers like to read all the documentation from top to bottom before writing a single line of code, others will start with the code editor right away. Instead of forcing a learning path, try to embrace the different mindsets and provide tools for everyone: specification files, <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/collection/\">Postman collections</a>, examples in different programming languages, an easy-to-access API sandbox (i.e. something that doesn\u2019t require installing an Enterprise product and waiting 2 weeks to get a license to make your first API call), a developer portal, tutorials and, why not, video walkthroughs. This might sound overwhelming but pays off in the end. With the proper design done first a lot of this content can be autogenerated from the specification files.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Document the data structure</strong>: if you can, don\u2019t just add lists of properties to your specs and docs: strive to provide proper descriptions of the fields that your API uses so that developers that are not fully familiar with your product can understand them. Remove ambiguity from the documentation as much as possible. This can go a long way, as developers can make mental models by understanding the data properly that often leads to better use cases than \u201c<em>just pull some data from this\u00a0API\u201d.</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use verbs, status codes, and error descriptions properly</strong>: leverage the power of the protocol you are using (i.e. HTTP when using REST APIs) to define how to do things and what responses mean. Proper usage of status codes and good error messages will dramatically reduce the number of requests to your support team. Developers are smart and want to solve problems quickly so if you provide them with the right information to do so, they won\u2019t bother you. Also, if you are properly logging and monitoring your API behavior, it will be easier for your support team to troubleshoot if your errors are not all \u201c500 Internal Server Error\u201d without any other\u00a0detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally,<strong> stay close to the developers</strong>: especially if your API is being used by people external from your organization, it\u2019s incredibly important to be close to them as much as you can to support them, learn and gather feedback on your API and its documentation. Allow everyone that is responsible for designing and engineering your API to be in that feedback loop, so they can share the learnings. Consider creating a community where people can ask questions and can expect quick answers (Slack, Reddit, Stack Overflow, etc.). I\u2019ve made great friendships this\u00a0way!</p>\n<h3>A few\u00a0examples</h3>\n<p>There are many great APIs out there. Here is a small, not complete, list of products from other companies that, for one reason or another, are strong examples of what I described in this blog\u00a0series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph\">Microsoft Graph</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/apis\">Google Cloud</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.virustotal.com/\">VirusTotal</a></li>\n<li>GitHub <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest\">REST</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/graphql\">GraphQL</a>\u00a0APIs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>And that\u2019s a wrap, thanks for reading! There are more things that I\u2019ve learned that I might share in future posts, but in my opinion, these are the most relevant ones. I hope you found this series useful: looking forward to hearing your feedback and comments!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b94d9e8532f5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-4-b94d9e8532f5\">Enterprise API design practices: Part 4</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog\">Palo Alto Networks Developer Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SmWJPvCF1Y5OMz_Wvxe5Vg.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dallimonti?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Andr\u00e9s Dallimonti</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cockpit?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to the last part of my series on creating <strong>valuable</strong>, <strong>usable </strong>and <strong>future-proof </strong>Enterprise APIs.

I\u2019ve made great friendships this\u00a0way!</p>\n<h3>A few\u00a0examples</h3>\n<p>There are many great APIs out there. Here is a small, not complete, list of products from other companies that, for one reason or another, are strong examples of what I described in this blog\u00a0series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph\">Microsoft Graph</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/apis\">Google Cloud</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.virustotal.com/\">VirusTotal</a></li>\n<li>GitHub <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest\">REST</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/graphql\">GraphQL</a>\u00a0APIs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>And that\u2019s a wrap, thanks for reading! There are more things that I\u2019ve learned that I might share in future posts, but in my opinion, these are the most relevant ones. I hope you found this series useful: looking forward to hearing your feedback and comments!</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b94d9e8532f5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-4-b94d9e8532f5\">Enterprise API design practices: Part 4</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog\">Palo Alto Networks Developer Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["developer-experience","development","api","design-patterns","enterprise-software"]},{"title":"Enterprise API design practices: Part 3","pubDate":"2021-02-23 09:59:43","link":"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-3-c56c3091c7d?source=rss----7f77455ad9a7---4","guid":"https://medium.com/p/c56c3091c7d","author":"Francesco Vigo","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jaVdQE1HOhSJrOK1sTNAaQ.jpeg","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jaVdQE1HOhSJrOK1sTNAaQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@youssef00?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Youssef Abdelwahab</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/skyscraper-crane?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to the third part of my series on creating <strong>valuable</strong>, <strong>usable, </strong>and <strong>future-proof </strong>Enterprise APIs. <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-1-1c5a47717ed0\">Part 1</a> covered some background context and the importance of design, while the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724\">second post</a> was about security and backend protection; this chapter is on optimization and\u00a0scale.</p>\n<h3>3. Optimize interactions</h3>\n<p>When dealing with scenarios that weren\u2019t anticipated in the initial release of an API (for example when integrating with an external product from a new partner), developers often have to rely on data-driven APIs to extract information from the backend and process it externally. While use-case-driven APIs are generally considered more useful, sometimes there might not be one available that suits the requirements of the novel use case that you must implement.</p>\n<p>By considering the following guidelines when building your data-driven APIs, you can make them easier to consume and more efficient for the backend and the network, improving performance and reducing the operational cost (fewer data transfers, faster and cheaper queries on the DBs,\u00a0etc.).</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll use an example with sample data. Consider the following data as a representation of your backend database: an imaginary set of alertsthat your Enterprise product detected over time. Instead of just three, imagine the following JSON output with thousands of\u00a0records:</p>\n<pre>{<br>    \"alerts\" : [<br>        {<br>            \"name\": \"Impossible Travel\",<br>            \"alert_type\": \"Behavior\",<br>            \"alert_status\": \"ACTIVE\",<br>            \"severity\": \"Critical\",<br>            \"created\": \"2020-09-27T09:27:33Z\",<br>            \"modified\": \"2020-09-28T14:34:44Z\",<br>            \"alert_id\": \"8493638e-af28-4a83-b1a9-12085fdbf5b3\",<br>            \"details\": \"... long blob of data ...\",<br>            \"evidence\": [<br>                \"long list of stuff\"<br>            ]<br>        },<br>        {<br>            \"name\": \"Malware Detected\",<br>            \"alert_type\": \"Endpoint\",<br>            \"alert_status\": \"ACTIVE\",<br>            \"severity\": \"High\",<br>            \"created\": \"2020-10-04T11:22:01Z\",<br>            \"modified\": \"2020-10-08T08:45:33Z\",<br>            \"alert_id\": \"b1018a33-e30f-43b9-9d07-c12d42646bbe\",<br>            \"details\": \"... long blob of data ...\",<br>            \"evidence\": [<br>                \"long list of stuff\"<br>            ]<br>        },<br>        {<br>            \"name\": \"Large Upload\",<br>            \"alert_type\": \"Network\",<br>            \"alert_status\": \"ACTIVE\",<br>            \"severity\": \"Low\",<br>            \"created\": \"2020-11-01T07:04:42Z\",<br>            \"modified\": \"2020-12-01T11:13:24Z\",<br>            \"alert_id\": \"c79ed6a8-bba0-4177-a9c5-39e7f95c86f2\",<br>            \"details\": \"... long blob of data ...\",<br>            \"evidence\": [<br>                \"long list of stuff\"<br>            ]<br>        }<br>    ]<br>}</pre>\n<p>Imagine implementing a simple /v1/alerts REST API endpoint to retrieve the data and you can\u2019t anticipate all the future needs. I recommend considering the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Filters</strong>: allow your consumers to reduce the result set by offering filtering capabilities in your API on as many fields as possible without stressing the backend too much (if some filters are not indexed it could become expensive, so you must find the right compromise). In the example above, good filters might include: <em>name</em>, <em>severity,</em> <em>alert_type, alert_status, created,</em> and <em>modified. </em>More complicated fields like <em>details</em> and <em>stack</em> might be too expensive for the backend (as they might require full-text search) and you would probably leave them out unless really required.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data formats: </strong>be very consistent in how you present and accept data across your API endpoints. This holds true especially for types such as numbers and dates, or complex structures. For example, to represent integers in JSON you can use numbers (i.e. \"fieldname\": 3) or strings (i.e. \"fieldname\": \"3\" ): no matter what you choose, you need to be consistent across all your API endpoints. And you should also use the same format when returning outputs and accepting inputs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dates: </strong>dates and times can be represented in many ways: timestamps (in seconds, milliseconds, microseconds), strings (ISO8601 such as in the example above, or custom formats such as 20200101), with or without time zone information. This can easily become a problem for the developers. Again, the key is consistency: try to accept and return only a single date format (i.e. timestamp in milliseconds or ISO8601) and be explicit about whether you consider time zones or not: usually choosing to do everything in UTC is a good idea because removes reduce ambiguity. <strong>Make sure to document the date formats properly.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Filter types: </strong>depending on the type of field, you should provide appropriate filters, not just <em>equals</em>. A good example is supporting <em>range filters </em>for dates that, in our example above, allow consumers to retrieve only the alerts created or modified in a specific interval. If some fields are enumerators with a limited number of possible values, it might be useful to support a <em>multi-select</em> filter (i.e. IN): in the example above it should be possible to filter by severity values and include only the High and Critical values using a single API\u00a0call.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sorting: </strong>is your API consumer interested only in the older alerts or the newest? Supporting sorting in your data-driven API is extremely important. One field to sort by is generally enough, but sometimes (depending on the data) you might need\u00a0more.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Result limiting and pagination</strong>: you can\u2019t expect all the entries to be returned at once (and your clients might not be interested or ready to ingest all of them anyway), so you should implement some logic where clients should retrieve a limited number of results and can get more when they need. If you are using pagination, clients should be able to specify the page size within a maximum allowed value. Defaults and maximums should be reasonable and properly documented.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Field limiting</strong>: consider whether you really need to return all the fields of your results all the time, or if your clients usually just need a few. By letting the client decide what fields (or groups of fields) your API should return, you can reduce the network throughput and backend cost, and performance. You should provide and document some sane default. In the example above, you could decide to return by default all the fields except details and evidence, which can be requested by the client only if they explicitly ask, using an include parameter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s put it all together. In the above example, you should be able to retrieve, using a single API call, something like\u00a0this:</p>\n<blockquote>Up to 100 alerts that were created between 2020\u201304\u201301T00:00:00Z (April 1st 2020) and 2020\u201310\u201301T00:00:00Z (October 1st 2020) with severity \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d, sorted by \u201cmodified\u201d date, newest first, including all the fields but \u201cevidence\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p>There are multiple ways you can implement this; through REST, <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a>, or custom query languages: in many cases, you don\u2019t need something too complex as often data sets are fairly simple. The proper way depends on many design considerations that are outside the scope of this post. But having some, or most of these capabilities in your API will make it better and more future proof. By the way, if you\u2019re into GraphQL, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://xuorig.medium.com/the-tension-between-data-use-case-driven-graphql-apis-8f982198653b\">this\u00a0post</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. Plan for\u00a0scale</h3>\n<p>A good API shouldn\u2019t be presumptuous: it shouldn\u2019t expect that clients are not doing anything else than waiting for its response, especially at scale, where performance is\u00a0key.</p>\n<p>If your API requires more than a few milliseconds to produce a response, I recommend considering supporting jobs instead. The logic can be as\u00a0follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement an API endpoint to start an operation that is supposed to take some time. If accepted, it would return immediately with a\u00a0<em>jobId</em><strong><em>.</em></strong>\n</li>\n<li>The client stores the jobId and periodically reaches out to a second endpoint that, when provided with the jobId, returns the completion status of the job (i.e. <em>running</em>, <em>completed</em>, <em>failed)</em>.</li>\n<li>Once results are available (or <em>some</em> are), the client can invoke a third endpoint to fetch the\u00a0results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other possible solutions include publisher/subscriber approaches or pushing data with <em>webhooks</em>, also depending on the size of the result set and the speed requirements<em>.</em> There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution, but I strongly recommend avoiding a polling logic where API clients are kept waiting for the server to reply while it\u2019s running long jobs in the\u00a0backend.</p>\n<p>If your need high performance and throughput when in your APIs, consider <a href=\"https://grpc.io/\">gRPC</a>, as its binary representation of data using protocol buffers has significant speed advantages over\u00a0REST.</p>\n<p>Side note: if you want to learn more about REST, GraphQL, webhooks, or gRPC use cases, I recommend starting from <a href=\"https://nordicapis.com/when-to-use-what-rest-graphql-webhooks-grpc/\">this\u00a0post</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, other considerations for scale include supporting batch operations on multiple entries at the same time (for example <em>mass updates</em>), but I recommend considering them only when you have a real use case in\u00a0mind.</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s next</h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-4-b94d9e8532f5\">next and last chapter</a>, I\u2019ll share some more suggestions about monitoring and supporting your API and developer ecosystem.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c56c3091c7d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-3-c56c3091c7d\">Enterprise API design practices: Part 3</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog\">Palo Alto Networks Developer Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jaVdQE1HOhSJrOK1sTNAaQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@youssef00?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Youssef Abdelwahab</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/skyscraper-crane?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to the third part of my series on creating <strong>valuable</strong>, <strong>usable, </strong>and <strong>future-proof </strong>Enterprise APIs. <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-1-1c5a47717ed0\">Part 1</a> covered some background context and the importance of design, while the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724\">second post</a> was about security and backend protection; this chapter is on optimization and\u00a0scale.</p>\n<h3>3.

If accepted, it would return immediately with a\u00a0<em>jobId</em><strong><em>.</em></strong>\n</li>\n<li>The client stores the jobId and periodically reaches out to a second endpoint that, when provided with the jobId, returns the completion status of the job (i.e. <em>running</em>, <em>completed</em>, <em>failed)</em>.</li>\n<li>Once results are available (or <em>some</em> are), the client can invoke a third endpoint to fetch the\u00a0results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other possible solutions include publisher/subscriber approaches or pushing data with <em>webhooks</em>, also depending on the size of the result set and the speed requirements<em>.</em> There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution, but I strongly recommend avoiding a polling logic where API clients are kept waiting for the server to reply while it\u2019s running long jobs in the\u00a0backend.</p>\n<p>If your need high performance and throughput when in your APIs, consider <a href=\"https://grpc.io/\">gRPC</a>, as its binary representation of data using protocol buffers has significant speed advantages over\u00a0REST.</p>\n<p>Side note: if you want to learn more about REST, GraphQL, webhooks, or gRPC use cases, I recommend starting from <a href=\"https://nordicapis.com/when-to-use-what-rest-graphql-webhooks-grpc/\">this\u00a0post</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, other considerations for scale include supporting batch operations on multiple entries at the same time (for example <em>mass updates</em>), but I recommend considering them only when you have a real use case in\u00a0mind.</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s next</h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-4-b94d9e8532f5\">next and last chapter</a>, I\u2019ll share some more suggestions about monitoring and supporting your API and developer ecosystem.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c56c3091c7d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-3-c56c3091c7d\">Enterprise API design practices: Part 3</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog\">Palo Alto Networks Developer Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["api-design","enterprise-software","design-patterns","development","api"]},{"title":"Enterprise API design practices: Part 2","pubDate":"2021-02-23 09:53:10","link":"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724?source=rss----7f77455ad9a7---4","guid":"https://medium.com/p/b316ca0c9724","author":"Francesco Vigo","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0DRNtTfd-C3bcw4NnpmIaw.jpeg","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0DRNtTfd-C3bcw4NnpmIaw.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dominik_photography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Dominik Vanyi</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/mining-truck?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to the second part of my series on creating <strong>valuable</strong>, <strong>usable </strong>and <strong>future-proof </strong>Enterprise APIs. In the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-1-1c5a47717ed0\">first post</a>, I covered some background context and the importance of design; this chapter is about security and protecting your\u00a0backend.</p>\n<h3>1. Secure your\u00a0APIs</h3>\n<p>Most of the projects I\u2019ve been involved with revolve around Cybersecurity, but I don\u2019t consider myself biased when I say that security should be a top priority for every Enterprise API. Misconfigurations and attacks are common and you should go long ways to protect your customers and their\u00a0data.</p>\n<p>Besides the common table stakes (i.e. use TLS and some form of authentication), when it comes to API security I recommend considering at least the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>API Credentials</strong>: <a href=\"https://oauth.net/\">OAuth 2</a> should lead the way but, especially for on-premise products, API Keys are still commonly used. In any case, you should support multiple sets of API credentials in your product to allow for more granularity and proper auditing and compliance. For example, every individual service (or user) that consumes your API should have a dedicated set of credentials, which will make it easier to track down from the audit logs who/what performed an operation and apply proper rate\u00a0limits.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>API RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</strong>: another important reason to support multiple sets of API credentials is the ability to assign different <em>permissions</em> to each set. This way your customers won\u2019t give administrative privileges to a set of credentials used, for example, to perform only read-only routine operations. Having RBAC is not enough: you need to guide your customers to use it properly: a good solution is to enforce a flow in your product UI that discourages users from creating API credentials with unnecessary permissions (assigning permissions in an additive way rather than subtractive, for example).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Credentials shouldn\u2019t last forever</strong>: it\u2019s a good practice to create sets of API credentials that expire at some point or require a manual reauthorization. For how long a credential should stay valid is a good question, as you want to make sure that a business process doesn\u2019t fail because someone forgot to reauthorize something that was set up 6 months ago. There are ways to mitigate this risk in your product UI. I recommend showing a list of the API credential sets (without showing the actual secrets!), when they expire, and how long ago they were used for the last time. This will help customers identify and delete stale credentials and refresh expiring\u00a0ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Protect your\u00a0backend</h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t trust your API users: they are likely to break things when given a chance! Not maliciously, of course, but there are so many things that can go wrong when you grant external users/applications access to the heart of your product through an API. And yes, bad guys and Denial of Service attacks exist\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>Similarly to Product UIs and CLI tools that validate user inputs and behavior, your APIs should do it too. But it goes beyond just making sure that all the required fields are present and correctly typed (if an API doesn\u2019t do it properly, I would file a bug to get it fixed): include <em>cost</em> and <em>performance</em> in your design considerations<em>.</em></p>\n<p>Consider the following examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Example 1: A proprietary API serving data from a Public Cloud database backend: in many cases such backends charge by the amount of data processed in each query. If your API allows consumers to freely search and return unlimited data from the backend, you might end up with an expensive bill.</li>\n<li>Example 2: An on-premise product with an API that allows users to provide files to be scanned for malicious behavior (i.e. a sandbox). A developer makes a mistake and forgets to add a <em>sleep() </em>in a cycle, hammering the API with tens of requests in a very short amount of time. If the API doesn\u2019t protect the product from this situation, it will likely not just slow down the API service itself, but it can probably have significant performance impacts on the server and all the other services running on it, including your product and its\u00a0UI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both examples are not uncommon for APIs designed exclusively for internal consumption (i.e. when if something goes wrong you can send an IM to the developer that is breaking your API and resolve the problem right\u00a0away).</p>\n<p>You should consider guidelines to mitigate these risk, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Shrink the result sets</strong>: try to support granularity when reading data from backends, for example by reducing the number of selected columns and slicing the results by time or other values. Set proper limits with sane defaults that don\u2019t overload the backend. More on this in the next\u00a0post.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rate limits</strong>: API rate limits are a practical way to tell your consumers that they need to slow down. Different consumers, identified with their sets of API credentials, should have their own limits, according to their strategic value, service level agreements, or monetization policy. Also, not all requests are equal: for example, some products implement rate limits using tokens. Each consumer has a limited number of tokens that replenish over time (or cost money) and each API call has a token <em>cost</em> that depends on a number of factors (i.e. impact on the backend load or business value of the service being consumed): once you run out of tokens you need to wait or buy\u00a0more.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communicate errors properly</strong>: when hitting rate limits, API consumers should receive a proper error code from the server (i.e. 429 if using HTTP) and the error message should specify how long until new API calls can be accepted for this client: this won\u2019t just improve DX, but will also allow the clients/SDKs to properly adapt and throttle their requests. Imagine that your API is used by a mobile app and they hit the rate limit: specifying how long they should wait before you are ready to accept a new request allows the app developer to show a popup in the UI to tell the end-user how long to wait. This will not just improve your API\u2019s DX, but will empower the app developers to provide a better U<em>ser Experience</em> (UX) to their customers!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What\u2019s next</h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-3-c56c3091c7d\">next chapter</a>, I\u2019ll dive deep into some technical suggestions on data-driven APIs and scale.

In this initial post, I will cover some background context and a very important lesson, before getting more technical in parts <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724\">two</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-3-c56c3091c7d\">three</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-4-b94d9e8532f5\">four</a>.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering why this matters, I recommend reading about the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2020/01/18/api-economy--is-it-the-next-big-thing/\">API\u00a0Economy</a>.</p>\n<p>In the last few years, thanks to my role as a Principal Solutions Architect at Palo Alto Networks, I\u2019ve <em>dealt with</em> a lot of APIs. Most of these APIs were offered by Enterprise companies, predominately in Cybersecurity. By <em>dealt with </em>I mean that I\u2019ve either written code to integrate with the APIs myself, or I\u2019ve helped other developers do it. During some of these integrations, I had the privilege of discussing issues and potential improvements with the Engineers and Product Managers responsible for product APIs. Meeting with these stakeholders and providing feedback often lead to API improvements and a stronger partnership.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I will share some of the things I\u2019ve learned about good API design that can lead to better business outcomes and fewer headaches for API builders and consumers, including better Developer Experience (DX) and more efficient operations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<em>There are tons of great resources out there about API best practices (such as the</em><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/apis/design\"><em> Google Cloud API Design Guide</em></a><em>) and this post is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but rather present a set of common patterns that I ran into. Places where I usually find very interesting content are: </em><a href=\"https://apisyouwonthate.com/\"><em>APIs you won\u2019t hate</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://nordicapis.com/\"><em>Nordic\u00a0APIs</em></a><em>.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Background context</h3>\n<p>Before sharing the lessons I\u2019ve learned, let me explain the context where most of my experience is based\u00a0upon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>B2B</strong>: Enterprise on-premise or SaaS products integrating with other Enterprise products (by partners) or custom applications/scripts (by customers).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top-down</strong>: some business mandate requires integrating with a specific product (i.e. because a joint customer was requesting an integration between two vendors), without the developers being able to choose an alternative that provided a better Developer Experience (DX). Sometimes we really had to bite the bullet and power through sub-optimal DX.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And in most cases we had the following goals and constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Speed</strong>: build something quickly and move on to the next project. That\u2019s how many Enterprise companies work when it comes to technology partnerships. While this doesn\u2019t sound ideal, there are several good business reasons: sales objection handling, customer acquisition, marketing, etc. You know that only a few ideas can be successful: similarly, many product integrations don\u2019t move the needle, so it\u2019s good to test many hypotheses quickly and invest properly only in the few that are worth\u00a0it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Build with what we have</strong>: because of the above requirement, we rarely had the opportunity to request API or Product changes before we had to ship something.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create value</strong>: doing things quickly doesn\u2019t mean you need to check a box that provides no value to customers. Even when the integration use cases were limited in scope, we always had an outcome in mind that could benefit some end-user.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance</strong>: don\u2019t create things that create performance issues on the APIs or, even worse, on the backing products. Or that could end up in significantly higher public cloud spending because they trigger expensive, non-optimized backend queries. APIs should protect themselves and the backing products from misuse but, in my experience, it\u2019s not always the case, especially with on-premise products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I believe that a different context could lead to different conclusions, I think that the <em>guidelines</em> that follow are valid for most scenarios. Let\u2019s begin with the most disruptive one.</p>\n<h3>0. Design first (if you can\u2026 but you really\u00a0should)</h3>\n<p>Although it might sound like preaching to the choir, my first recommendation is to adopt the <a href=\"https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-design-first-vs-code-first\">design-first approach</a> when creating APIs. This also (especially!) holds true for Enterprise products even though it may sound hard because APIs are too often not perceived as first-class components of a product (or as products by themselves). I\u2019ve seen a lot of different scenarios, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>APIs created to decouple the client logic from the server backend, without thinking about any other consumer than the product UI itself (a good example of a great idea made much less effective).</li>\n<li>APIs that basically just exposed the underlying database with some authentication in front of\u00a0it.</li>\n<li>APIs created only to satisfy a very narrow/specific feature request coming from a customer and evolved in the same, very tactical, way, feature by\u00a0feature.</li>\n<li>APIs meant to be internal-only that were later exposed to external consumers because of a business request. By the way, this breaks the <a href=\"https://nordicapis.com/the-bezos-api-mandate-amazons-manifesto-for-externalization/\">so-called Bezos API Mandate</a> and is usually a primary cause of technical debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The examples above often performed poorly when we tried to consume those APIs in real-world integration use cases, leading to poor DX and reliance on client-side logic to work around the problems, which many times translated into lower quality results and developer fatigue (more on this in part\u00a04).</p>\n<p>But such approaches aren\u2019t necessarily wrong: arguably you can\u2019t really know all the potential use cases of an API when you ship its first iteration and you gotta start somewhere but, <em>if you understand that you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know</em>, you can at least mitigate the risks. And the easiest and cheapest way to mitigate risks is to do it earlier on, hence I strongly recommend to embrace a <strong>design-first approach</strong> when creating\u00a0APIs.</p>\n<p>However, if you really want or are forced to follow a <em>code-first approach</em>, you can still apply most of the guidelines presented in this series as you develop your\u00a0APIs.</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s next</h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724\">next post</a>, I\u2019ll cover some security and backend considerations.

In this initial post, I will cover some background context and a very important lesson, before getting more technical in parts <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724\">two</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-3-c56c3091c7d\">three</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-4-b94d9e8532f5\">four</a>.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering why this matters, I recommend reading about the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2020/01/18/api-economy--is-it-the-next-big-thing/\">API\u00a0Economy</a>.</p>\n<p>In the last few years, thanks to my role as a Principal Solutions Architect at Palo Alto Networks, I\u2019ve <em>dealt with</em> a lot of APIs. Most of these APIs were offered by Enterprise companies, predominately in Cybersecurity. By <em>dealt with </em>I mean that I\u2019ve either written code to integrate with the APIs myself, or I\u2019ve helped other developers do it. During some of these integrations, I had the privilege of discussing issues and potential improvements with the Engineers and Product Managers responsible for product APIs. Meeting with these stakeholders and providing feedback often lead to API improvements and a stronger partnership.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I will share some of the things I\u2019ve learned about good API design that can lead to better business outcomes and fewer headaches for API builders and consumers, including better Developer Experience (DX) and more efficient operations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<em>There are tons of great resources out there about API best practices (such as the</em><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/apis/design\"><em> Google Cloud API Design Guide</em></a><em>) and this post is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but rather present a set of common patterns that I ran into. Places where I usually find very interesting content are: </em><a href=\"https://apisyouwonthate.com/\"><em>APIs you won\u2019t hate</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://nordicapis.com/\"><em>Nordic\u00a0APIs</em></a><em>.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Background context</h3>\n<p>Before sharing the lessons I\u2019ve learned, let me explain the context where most of my experience is based\u00a0upon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>B2B</strong>: Enterprise on-premise or SaaS products integrating with other Enterprise products (by partners) or custom applications/scripts (by customers).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top-down</strong>: some business mandate requires integrating with a specific product (i.e. because a joint customer was requesting an integration between two vendors), without the developers being able to choose an alternative that provided a better Developer Experience (DX). Sometimes we really had to bite the bullet and power through sub-optimal DX.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And in most cases we had the following goals and constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Speed</strong>: build something quickly and move on to the next project. That\u2019s how many Enterprise companies work when it comes to technology partnerships. While this doesn\u2019t sound ideal, there are several good business reasons: sales objection handling, customer acquisition, marketing, etc. You know that only a few ideas can be successful: similarly, many product integrations don\u2019t move the needle, so it\u2019s good to test many hypotheses quickly and invest properly only in the few that are worth\u00a0it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Build with what we have</strong>: because of the above requirement, we rarely had the opportunity to request API or Product changes before we had to ship something.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create value</strong>: doing things quickly doesn\u2019t mean you need to check a box that provides no value to customers. Even when the integration use cases were limited in scope, we always had an outcome in mind that could benefit some end-user.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance</strong>: don\u2019t create things that create performance issues on the APIs or, even worse, on the backing products. Or that could end up in significantly higher public cloud spending because they trigger expensive, non-optimized backend queries. APIs should protect themselves and the backing products from misuse but, in my experience, it\u2019s not always the case, especially with on-premise products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I believe that a different context could lead to different conclusions, I think that the <em>guidelines</em> that follow are valid for most scenarios. Let\u2019s begin with the most disruptive one.</p>\n<h3>0. Design first (if you can\u2026 but you really\u00a0should)</h3>\n<p>Although it might sound like preaching to the choir, my first recommendation is to adopt the <a href=\"https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-design-first-vs-code-first\">design-first approach</a> when creating APIs. This also (especially!) holds true for Enterprise products even though it may sound hard because APIs are too often not perceived as first-class components of a product (or as products by themselves). I\u2019ve seen a lot of different scenarios, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>APIs created to decouple the client logic from the server backend, without thinking about any other consumer than the product UI itself (a good example of a great idea made much less effective).</li>\n<li>APIs that basically just exposed the underlying database with some authentication in front of\u00a0it.</li>\n<li>APIs created only to satisfy a very narrow/specific feature request coming from a customer and evolved in the same, very tactical, way, feature by\u00a0feature.</li>\n<li>APIs meant to be internal-only that were later exposed to external consumers because of a business request. By the way, this breaks the <a href=\"https://nordicapis.com/the-bezos-api-mandate-amazons-manifesto-for-externalization/\">so-called Bezos API Mandate</a> and is usually a primary cause of technical debt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The examples above often performed poorly when we tried to consume those APIs in real-world integration use cases, leading to poor DX and reliance on client-side logic to work around the problems, which many times translated into lower quality results and developer fatigue (more on this in part\u00a04).</p>\n<p>But such approaches aren\u2019t necessarily wrong: arguably you can\u2019t really know all the potential use cases of an API when you ship its first iteration and you gotta start somewhere but, <em>if you understand that you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know</em>, you can at least mitigate the risks. And the easiest and cheapest way to mitigate risks is to do it earlier on, hence I strongly recommend to embrace a <strong>design-first approach</strong> when creating\u00a0APIs.</p>\n<p>However, if you really want or are forced to follow a <em>code-first approach</em>, you can still apply most of the guidelines presented in this series as you develop your\u00a0APIs.</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s next</h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://medium.com/palo-alto-networks-developer-blog/enterprise-api-design-practices-part-2-b316ca0c9724\">next post</a>, I\u2019ll cover some security and backend considerations.

The remaining 32 characters are a truncated SHA256 hash of the \u201cServer hello\u201d extensions returned by the server.

You can already implement trackers in hundreds of ways, but in most architectures some of the requirements listed above require ad-hoc coding, are painful to implement (looking at you, \u201c<em>user interaction</em>\u201d) or expensive (<em>CDN</em>). <strong>With GitHub Actions instead you have all the requirements offered as services in a nice package, ready to\u00a0use.</strong></p>\n<p>The following lines guide you thru the process of setting up a Cloud Services tracker, using some simple code we implemented to smooth some of the tasks.

GitHub Actions follows the same patterns used by other Continuous Integration services\u200a\u2014\u200ato configure GitHub\u00a0Actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a workflow definition file inside the directory\u00a0.github/workflows of your GitHub repo, using\u00a0YAML</li>\n<li>specify in the workflow file one or more list of <em>steps</em> to be executed and when they should be executed (the <em>triggers</em>)</li>\n<li>commit &amp;\u00a0push</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a real world example to give you a better idea on how GitHub Actions workflows work and how to use them for scraping. The following is a commented excerpt taken from the source of my inspiration\u200a\u2014\u200athe repo <a href=\"https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/blob/master/.github/workflows/scrape.yml\">alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper</a>. This workflow has a single <em>job</em> called scheduled that downloads the data of the US2020 Presidential Election and updates local tables, pushing the results back into the\u00a0repo:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3183297900eed9d277f81b1bd898ec4d/href\">https://medium.com/media/3183297900eed9d277f81b1bd898ec4d/href</a><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/338ae661555bf56b31eeed4215ff8ae6/href\">https://medium.com/media/338ae661555bf56b31eeed4215ff8ae6/href</a><p>As you can see the scraping workflow is extremely easy to understand and flexible. For tracking Cloud Services we need some additional steps for processing and double checking the scraping results, but not too\u00a0many.</p>\n<p>You can find the full documentation with a more in-depth Quickstart on the official GitHub Action webpage: <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions\">https://docs.github.com/en/actions</a></p>\n<h3>Tracking Cloud\u00a0Services</h3>\n<p>To track Cloud Services endpoints we want a GitHub Action workflow looking like\u00a0this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Checkout</strong> the\u00a0repo</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fetch</strong> the latest version of list of endpoints used by a Cloud Service from their feed/API/webpage</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Filter</strong> the list (if we want to exclude some IP ranges or\u00a0URLs)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transform</strong> the list in a format we can\u00a0consume</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Check</strong> the change in the latest version of the list against the one stored in the\u00a0repo</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Update</strong>. If the change is not <em>big</em>, commit the changes &amp; push. If the change is <em>big</em>, open a PR and ask for manual approval.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Why do we want check the changes before pushing?</strong> as an additional safeguard against breaking changes. Breaking changes could happen for a variety of reasons,\u00a0example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formatting errors in the endpoint list provided by the Cloud\u00a0Service</li>\n<li>structural changes in the webpage where the endpoints are listed, this for Cloud Services that provides the endpoint lists on webpages instead of JSON\u00a0files</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed solution here is to detect <em>big</em> changes (for some definition of <em>big</em>) and ask for manual approval before updating the list if a <em>big</em> change is detected.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s follow the steps one by one and see how we can implement our workflow. You can find a live example in<a href=\"http://jtschichold/mm-cloud-services-endpoints-tests\"> jtschichold/mm-cloud-services-endpoints-tests</a></p>\n<h4>1. Checkout the\u00a0repo</h4>\n<p>This is simple, there is a GitHub Action for that\u200a\u2014\u200aaction/checkout:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d4c6d3e4dc9f8cbfb9ce251587192125/href\">https://medium.com/media/d4c6d3e4dc9f8cbfb9ce251587192125/href</a><p>Without arguments, the action checkouts the repo in the current directory from the default branch, or the default branch for the triggering event.</p>\n<h4>2. Fetch</h4>\n<p>Many endpoint lists are published as JSON files and easy to fetch using curl and post process using jq. But not all of them. To simplify this process we have a created a GitHub Action called jtschichold\\mm-cloud-services-miners that can be used to fetch endpoint lists from a number of Cloud Services. The action has been designed to be easy to extend. If you need a Cloud Service that is not supported by the action feel free to open a PR\u00a0:-)</p>\n<p>We can use the action in the workflow in the following way:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/56b82025cd39fdabccd8cd15b0ce6931/href\">https://medium.com/media/56b82025cd39fdabccd8cd15b0ce6931/href</a><p>The config input of the action points to a config file in the repo where the action finds the details about what to fetch and where to save the\u00a0results:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a7c9c3179729991cb35d92169238d9e7/href\">https://medium.com/media/a7c9c3179729991cb35d92169238d9e7/href</a><p>The resulting files are JSON files with the list of the select IP Ranges. As an example, public-cloud-azuread-ips.txt looks like\u00a0this:</p>\n<pre>[<br>  \"13.64.151.161/32\",<br>  \"13.66.141.64/27\",<br>  \"13.67.9.224/27\",<br>...<br>  \"2603:1006:2000::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1007:200::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1016:1400::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1017::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1026:3000::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1027:1::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1036:3000::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1037:1::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1046:2000::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1047:1::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1056:2000::/48\",<br>  \"2603:1057:2::/48\"<br>]</pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation of the action on the homepage <a href=\"https://github.com/jtschichold/mm-cloud-services-miners\">jtschichold/mm-cloud-services-miners</a></p>\n<h4>3 &amp; 4. Filter &amp; Transform</h4>\n<p>Now we have fetched the list of the endpoints, next step is filtering the lists for extra security and transform the lists in a format that can be consumed.</p>\n<p>We have created 2 GitHub Actions to simplify this step, both of them do filter &amp; transform lists\u200a\u2014\u200aone for IPs and one for\u00a0URLs:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jtschichold/mm-process-ip-list\">jtschichold/mm-process-ip-list</a> is used to filter IP lists, transform the lists in plain text format and (optionally) aggregate multiple lists. It can filter IP\u00a0lists:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to exclude IP ranges overlapping a list of CIDRS read from a\u00a0file</li>\n<li>to exclude IP ranges with a small subnet mask (like 0.0.0.0/0\u2026)</li>\n<li>to exclude IP ranges overlapping Reserved IP addresses (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses\">Wikipedia</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jtschichold/mm-process-urls-list\">jtschichold/mm-process-urls-list</a> is instead used to filter URL lists, transform the lists in other formats and (optionally again) aggregate multiple lists. It can filter URL lists to exclude URLs matching a list of regular expressions read from a\u00a0file.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see how can we use jtschichold/mm-process-ip-list to filter the lists we have created during the fetch\u00a0step:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c58e32a403d202acd6a1d748d9c08cba/href\">https://medium.com/media/c58e32a403d202acd6a1d748d9c08cba/href</a><p>After this step, public-cloud-azuread-ips.txt looks like\u00a0this:</p>\n<pre>13.64.151.161/32<br>13.66.141.64/27<br>13.67.9.224/27<br>...<br>2603:1006:2000::/48<br>2603:1007:200::/48<br>2603:1016:1400::/48<br>2603:1017::/48<br>2603:1026:3000::/48<br>2603:1027:1::/48<br>2603:1036:3000::/48<br>2603:1037:1::/48<br>2603:1046:2000::/48<br>2603:1047:1::/48<br>2603:1056:2000::/48<br>2603:1057:2::/48</pre>\n<h4>5 &amp; 6. Check &amp;\u00a0Update</h4>\n<p>Before pushing the update to the repo, we want to make sure the new lists didn\u2019t change <em>much</em>. As git is the perfect tool track versions of text files, we can just use its abilities to compute some metrics over the changes in the new version of the feeds.

You can already implement trackers in hundreds of ways, but in most architectures some of the requirements listed above require ad-hoc coding, are painful to implement (looking at you, \u201c<em>user interaction</em>\u201d) or expensive (<em>CDN</em>). <strong>With GitHub Actions instead you have all the requirements offered as services in a nice package, ready to\u00a0use.</strong></p>\n<p>The following lines guide you thru the process of setting up a Cloud Services tracker, using some simple code we implemented to smooth some of the tasks. Thanks to the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/about-billing-for-github-actions\">Pricing structure</a> you can test this idea for free (as long as you keep your repo\u00a0public).</p>\n<h3>Quick introduction to GitHub\u00a0Actions</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">GitHub Actions</a> is the Continuous Integration framework offered by GitHub and tightly integrated with their GitHub platform. GitHub Actions follows the same patterns used by other Continuous Integration services\u200a\u2014\u200ato configure GitHub\u00a0Actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a workflow definition file inside the directory\u00a0.github/workflows of your GitHub repo, using\u00a0YAML</li>\n<li>specify in the workflow file one or more list of <em>steps</em> to be executed and when they should be executed (the <em>triggers</em>)</li>\n<li>commit &amp;\u00a0push</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a real world example to give you a better idea on how GitHub Actions workflows work and how to use them for scraping. The following is a commented excerpt taken from the source of my inspiration\u200a\u2014\u200athe repo <a href=\"https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/blob/master/.github/workflows/scrape.yml\">alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper</a>. This workflow has a single <em>job</em> called scheduled that downloads the data of the US2020 Presidential Election and updates local tables, pushing the results back into the\u00a0repo:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3183297900eed9d277f81b1bd898ec4d/href\">https://medium.com/media/3183297900eed9d277f81b1bd898ec4d/href</a><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/338ae661555bf56b31eeed4215ff8ae6/href\">https://medium.com/media/338ae661555bf56b31eeed4215ff8ae6/href</a><p>As you can see the scraping workflow is extremely easy to understand and flexible. For tracking Cloud Services we need some additional steps for processing and double checking the scraping results, but not too\u00a0many.</p>\n<p>You can find the full documentation with a more in-depth Quickstart on the official GitHub Action webpage: <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions\">https://docs.github.com/en/actions</a></p>\n<h3>Tracking Cloud\u00a0Services</h3>\n<p>To track Cloud Services endpoints we want a GitHub Action workflow looking like\u00a0this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Checkout</strong> the\u00a0repo</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fetch</strong> the latest version of list of endpoints used by a Cloud Service from their feed/API/webpage</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Filter</strong> the list (if we want to exclude some IP ranges or\u00a0URLs)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transform</strong> the list in a format we can\u00a0consume</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Check</strong> the change in the latest version of the list against the one stored in the\u00a0repo</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Update</strong>. If the change is not <em>big</em>, commit the changes &amp; push. If the change is <em>big</em>, open a PR and ask for manual approval.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Why do we want check the changes before pushing?</strong> as an additional safeguard against breaking changes. Breaking changes could happen for a variety of reasons,\u00a0example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>formatting errors in the endpoint list provided by the Cloud\u00a0Service</li>\n<li>structural changes in the webpage where the endpoints are listed, this for Cloud Services that provides the endpoint lists on webpages instead of JSON\u00a0files</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed solution here is to detect <em>big</em> changes (for some definition of <em>big</em>) and ask for manual approval before updating the list if a <em>big</em> change is detected.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s follow the steps one by one and see how we can implement our workflow.

We just need to hook this code into the syslog stream and call xdrAlertPipe.write(line) with every message we receive from the\u00a0System-X</p>\n<h3>Incidents triggered by the integration</h3>\n<p>You might have noticed that our integration is pushing alerts with the Medium severity level. Alerts with levels Informational and Low are considered by Cortex XDR as insights. Alerts with levels Medium and High will be promoted to incidents instead.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Et9UnhlimVYGwm1aKJLvyA.png\"><figcaption>Integration-triggered Cortex XDR\u00a0incident</figcaption></figure><p>Now, in our XDR dashboard, we have a new incident triggered by our integration code.

In this case, it provides additional insights to the Security Engineer like process being used in the client (putty.exe) parent process, command line arguments and, obviously, all details on the endpoint being used for the connection.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In some corner cases (i.e. threat data generated by closed systems) your security engineer might have some blind spots. The Cortex XDR API enables, among many other uses cases, the construction of integrations that can extract information from these systems (i.e. through Syslog) and push them as insights or incidents to the management console.</li>\n<li>The REST Cortex XDR API is very easy to consume with API Keys that can be tailored to every use case (access control) as well as security requirement.</li>\n<li>A NodeJS / TypeScript library exists for quick starting integrations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>References</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>How does Cortex XDR work?
