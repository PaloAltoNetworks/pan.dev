## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Authentication Service

You use the Authentication Service to obtain an access token using a Client ID and Client Secret
that you obtain when you [create a service account](/sase-services/docs/service-accounts).
You also need the [TSG ID](/sase-services/docs/tenant-service-groups) for the tenant service group 
for which you want to create the access token.

You can also use the Authentication Service to retrieve oAuth 2.0 claims about the user who was
issued an access token.
