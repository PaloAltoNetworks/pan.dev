## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Role assignment

For API access, roles must be applied to a service account. However, you
can also apply roles to an ordinary user account. These roles have meaning
for users who are logging in through the user interface to configure or
monitor SASE products.

**Note:** Roles can never be in conflict. If an account has a role that
grants read or view only access to a resource, and another role grants
read-write access, then the more permissive role is applied (read-write).

Regardless of whether you're assigning a role to a service account or a
user account, you use the [Create an access policy](/sase-services/api/identity-and-access-management/accesspolicies#operation/createaccess_policy) API to assign the
role.
(Of course, you can also do this using the multitenant user interface.)

If you are assigning a role to service account, then provide the service
account Client ID in this API's `principal` field. This is an email address
that looks like this:

`my_service_account@1111111111.iam.panserviceaccount.com`

If you are assigning a role to a user account, use that user's email
address for the `principal` field.

Be aware that this email address must be used to [create a
Palo Alto Networks customer support account](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/UserAccount/PreRegister),
or the user account will not be able to gain the access that you specify.

Also be aware that this API does not check if the specified email address
corresponds to a customer support account. If the email address that you
specify is not currently used for a user or service account, the API call
creates a new user account within the SASE system. But a corresponding
customer service account is not created.
