## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Create Access Tokens

To obtain an access token using SASE Services, you must have already 
[created at least one TSG](/sase-services/docs/tenant-service-groups)
and [created a service account](/sase-services/docs/service-accounts) for it.
When you did these things, you obtained:

* A TSG ID, which you use to identify the scope of the access token.
* A Client ID
* A Client Secret

Using this information, you can use
[POST /oauth2/access_token](/sase-services/api/auth-service/authservice#operation/post-oauth2-access_token)
to create an access token. This API uses basic auth. Use your Client ID for the username, and Client
Secret for the password. Use the `scope` field to provide the TSG ID as follows:

    curl -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=TSG_ID:<tsg_id>" \
    -u <client_id>:<client_secret> \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -X POST https://api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com/oauth2/access_token

**Note**: The service account that you use to authenticate this request must belong to the TSG that
you identify on the `scope` field. See [Acess Token Scopes](/sase-services/docs/scope) for more information.

Access tokens have a lifespan of 15 minutes.
