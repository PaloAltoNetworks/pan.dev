## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Scopes

You use a [service account](/sase-services/docs/service-accounts) to identify the tenant service
group (TSG) or tenant to which you want to perform API access. If the TSG or tenant does not have
a service account, then you cannot perform API access against it.
This is a 1:1 relationship. That is, if you have a tenant, `Tenant 1A`, with a service
account named `1A_svc`, then you use that service account to obtain an access token.
That access token cannot be used to perform API calls against any other tenant.
All API requests made using that access token are routed to the tenant based on the TSG ID contained
in the access token.

**Note:** The TSG IDs used here are intentionally fake. Real TSG IDs are 10-digit integers.

**Note:** The difference between a tenant and a tenant service group, is a tenant is a leaf node
in the tenant hierachy. That is, a TSG has children, a tenant does not. But both tenants and TSGs
have TSG IDs. You use this ID for the scope when you create an access token for that tenant.

## Scope within a TSG hierarchy

When you use multiple tenants, you will organize them in a hierarchy of TSGs and tenants.
You can, if you want, create a dedicated service account for every TSG and tenant in your hierarchy.
This is the simplest case, but it isn't necessary. The service account for a TSG can specify
the TSG ID of any descendent of that TSG when it creates an access token.

Consider the following diagram. `TSG A` is the root tenant service group, and it has two 
tenants: `Tenant 1A` and `Tenant 2A`. It also has a child TSG, `TSG B`, with two tenants: 
`Tenant 1B` and `Tenant 2B`:

In this scenario:

* TSG A can create an access token specifying any TSG_ID in the heirarchy, because every tenant and
TSG is a child of TSG A.

* Tenant 1A, Tenant 2A, Tenant 1B, and Tenant 2B cannot create access tokens directly because they
do not have service accounts.

* TSG B can create access tokens specifying the TSG_ID for itself, plus Tenant 1B and Tenant 2B
because those are children of TSG B.

* TSG B _cannot_ create access tokens for TSG A, Tenant 1A, or Tenant 2A because they are either
peers or an ancestor in the hierarchy.

## Using scope outside of the hierarchy

In the previous scenario, we showed that TSG B was unable to create an access token for API access
to Tenant 1A. But there might be situations where you need to do this. To work around the TSG
hierarchy restrictions, you can create an ordinary user account for Tenant 1A using the Client ID
for the `b_svc` service account. This will allow the b_svc service account to create an access token
for API access to Tenant 1a. service account.

You can accomplish this task using the multitenant UI, or you can use the Identity and Access
Management [create an access policy](/sase-services/api/identity-and-access-management/accesspolicies#operation/createaccess_policy) API.
For example:

    curl -d "role=superuser&resource=prn:18::::&principal=b_svc@15.iam.panserviceaccount.com" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_WITH_TSG_15>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST https://api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com/access_policies
