## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Overview

SASE Services offer a common authentication mechanism and FQDNs for API requests. They also offer a
means by which you can create service accounts, and manage roles and permissions for those accounts. 

The authentication mechanism offered by SASE Services is oAuth2. To learn about access tokens and
access token creation, see the [authentication
overview](/sase-services/docs/authentication-overview).

You can also use SASE services to [grant user accounts access to
tenants](/sase-services/docs/roles-assign).
