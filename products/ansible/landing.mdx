## The PAN-OS Collection - Certified and Supported

![Automation Hub Graphic](aap2.png)

The collection of Ansible modules for PAN-OS has been officially certified by the Red Hat Ansible team ([list of Ansible certified content](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3642632)) since version 2.12.2.

If you are an Ansible Automation Platform subscriber, you will be able to see [the collection in Automation Hub](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/paloaltonetworks/panos), and the collection will be supported as part of your ongoing support agreement/offering. Red Had and Palo Alto Networks have collaborated extensively in order to bring the collection into [Automation Hub](https://cloud.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/), and to provide you with a supported solution for automating your PAN-OS operations and configuration tasks, with Ansible.

If you are a user of the free and open-source Ansible offerings, you will still be able to use the collection of Ansible modules for PAN-OS as you always have done previously; the PAN-OS collection will continue to be published to [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/paloaltonetworks/panos), as well as to Automation Hub.

All users of the PAN-OS collection will also benefit from the revised and updated [set of getting started tutorials, how-to guides, and background information](/ansible/docs/panos/), which is now published here on pan.dev.
