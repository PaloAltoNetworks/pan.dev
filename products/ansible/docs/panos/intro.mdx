# Ansible for PAN-OS

You can configure and operate PAN-OS with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), including defining and managing your configuration as code, and automating your operations.

## Documentation

This documentation is split into four sections:

- Getting started tutorials: Start here if you are new to Ansible for PAN-OS
- How-to guides: Useful for achieving real-world objectives, or solving specific challenges
- Background information: Higher level content discussing the "why"
- Reference: Lists the modules available for PAN-OS, with their correct usage including examples

# Collection Reference

The reference guide for all modules contained within the PAN-OS collection can be found [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/paloaltonetworks/panos/docs). This provides the listing of modules, with their parameters, valid inputs and types, and examples of correct usage.

## Support

As of version 2.12.2, the Collection of Ansible Modules for PAN-OS is certified on [Ansible Automation Hub](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/paloaltonetworks/panos) (also viewable in [Ecosystem Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/collection/paloaltonetworks/panos?tab=overview)) and officially supported for Ansible subscribers. Ansible subscribers can engage for support through their usual route towards Red Hat.

For those who are not Ansible subscribers, this Collection of Ansible Modules is also published on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/paloaltonetworks/panos) to be freely used under an as-is, best effort, support policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and Palo Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (the VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or script itself.

## Open-Source

The collection of Ansible modules for PAN-OS is free and open-source software, released under the Apache License 2.0, and source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-ansible).
