# Import and load a configuration file

In this guide, you will import a PAN-OS XML configuration file to your NGFW, then load the config into candidate configuration. This is most commonly done when restoring from a backup.

<Assumptions />

## Create playbook files and define connectivity to the firewall

Create a new Ansible yaml file named `import-and-load-config.yml`, establish a variable block called `device` for the firewall, and reference the PAN-OS collection:

```yaml
---
- name: Import and load a configuration file
  hosts: '{{ target | default("firewall") }}'
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "{{ ip_address }}"
      username: "{{ username | default(omit) }}"
      password: "{{ password | default(omit) }}"
      api_key: "{{ api_key | default(omit) }}"

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos
```

## Import the configuration file

You will first import a valid PAN-OS XML configuration file to the NGFW. The file should be stored in a location accessible to the host executing Ansible, and could be passed as an extra runtime variable. For one-off operations, the variable could be defined in the playbook itself

```yaml
cfg_file: "exampleconfig.xml"
```

The first tasks in the playbook by uses `panos_import` to import/upload the XML config file:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Import configuration
    paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_import:
      provider: "{{ device }}"
      file: "{{ cfg_file }}"
      category: "configuration"
    register: result
```

## Load the configuration file

Continue the tasks by loading the imported config file. This will use `panos_loadcfg` to make the imported config file the new candidate configuration:

```yaml
- name: Load configuration
  paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_loadcfg:
    ip_address: "{{ device.ip_address }}"
    username: "{{ device.username }}"
    password: "{{ device.password }}"
    file: "{{ result.filename }}"
```

## Commit the imported configuration

To make the imported configuration "live", a commit is required to promote the candidate configuration into the running configuration:

```yaml
- name: Commit candidate configuration
  panos_commit_firewall:
    provider: "{{ device }}"
  register: results
- debug:
    msg: "Commit with job ID: {{ results.jobid }} had output: {{ results.details }}"
```

## Final playbook

Putting all the sections together, the playbook in entirety looks like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Import and load a configuration file
  hosts: '{{ target | default("firewall") }}'
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "{{ ip_address }}"
      username: "{{ username | default(omit) }}"
      password: "{{ password | default(omit) }}"
      api_key: "{{ api_key | default(omit) }}"

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos

  tasks:
    - name: Import configuration
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_import:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        file: "{{ cfg_file }}"
        category: "configuration"
      register: result

    - name: Load configuration
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_loadcfg:
        ip_address: "{{ device.ip_address }}"
        username: "{{ device.username }}"
        password: "{{ device.password }}"
        file: "{{ result.filename }}"

    - name: Commit candidate configuration
      panos_commit_firewall:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
      register: results
    - debug:
        msg: "Commit with job ID: {{ results.jobid }} had output: {{ results.details }}"
```
