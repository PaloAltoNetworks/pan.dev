# Creating Address Objects from a CSV File

In this guide, you will create a number of address objects using a CSV file as the source configuration data. This is a common task when data is provided to you in a generic format like [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

The playbook created in this guide can be modified for data in CSV in many formats. For this example, we will use a format like this which includes a header row:

```csv
hostname,ip
test1,1.1.1.1
test2,2.2.2.2
test3,3.3.3.3
test4,4.4.4.4
```

## Create playbook files and define connectivity to the firewall

Create a new Ansible yaml file named `csv-address-objects.yml`, establish a variable block called `device` for the firewall, and reference the PAN-OS collection:

```yaml
---
- name: Create Address Object from a CSV Source File
  hosts: '{{ target | default("firewall") }}'
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "{{ ip_address }}"
      username: "{{ username | default(omit) }}"
      password: "{{ password | default(omit) }}"
      api_key: "{{ api_key | default(omit) }}"

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos
```

## Read the CSV file

You will first read in the CSV and `register` the data to a variable. The file should be stored in a location accessible to the host executing Ansible, and could be passed as an extra runtime variable. For one-off operations, the variable could be defined in the playbook itself

```yaml
csv_filename: "../test.csv"
```

The first task in the playbook by uses `read_csv` to load the CSV file and store (`register`) the data in a variable called `csv_data`:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Read CSV file
    ansible.builtin.read_csv:
      path: "{{ csv_filename }}"
      key: hostname
    register: csv_data
```

## Create address objects with a loop

You will now use the `panos_address_object` module, with an extra statement `with_items` at the end. This is one looping mechanism available in Ansible (more details [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_loops.html)). The `with_items` statement asks the module to loop over the data passed in, which in your case is the `csv_data` from the first task (passed in `dict` format and looped over with `dict2items`):

```yaml
    - name: Create address objects
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_address_object:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        name: "{{ item.value.hostname }}"
        value: "{{ item.value.ip }}"
      // highlight-next-line
      with_items: "{{ csv_data.dict | dict2items }}"
```

## Add the new address objects to a group

The playbook could end there if your only objective is to create address objects based on the CSV source file. A follow-on task adds the newly created address objects to an address group. First, you will use `set_fact` to create a list of the address object names, based on the `csv_data` data from the CSV file, and store the list in a variable called `address_objects_list`:

```yaml
- name: Create a list of the address objects
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    address_objects_list: "{{ csv_data.dict | dict2items | map(attribute='key') | list }}"
```

The list of address object names can now be added to an address group:

```yaml
    - name: Add address objects to address group
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_address_group:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        name: test_group
        // highlight-next-line
        static_value: "{{ address_objects_list }}"
```

Note that if the address group defined in the above task already exists, Ansible will overwrite the list of address objects in the group. If your goal is to add the new address objects to the existing group (not overwrite the existing list of address objects), use `state: merged` per the example below:

```yaml
    - name: Add address objects to address group
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_address_group:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        name: test_group
        static_value: "{{ address_objects_list }}"
        // highlight-next-line
        state: merged
```

## Create a security rule

Finally for this playbook, you will create a security rule which uses the address group created in the previous task:

```yaml
    - name: Create a security rule
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_security_rule:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        state: "present"
        rule_name: "Test rule"
        source_zone: ["any"]
        destination_zone: ["any"]
        // highlight-next-line
        source_ip: ["test_group"]
        source_user: ["any"]
        destination_ip: ["any"]
        application: ["ssh"]
        action: "allow"
```

## Final playbook

Putting all the sections together, the playbook in entirety looks like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Create Address Object from a CSV Source File
  hosts: "firewall"
  connection: local

  vars:
    device:
      ip_address: "{{ ip_address }}"
      username: "{{ username }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"

    csv_filename: "../test.csv"

  collections:
    - paloaltonetworks.panos

  tasks:
    - name: Read CSV file
      ansible.builtin.read_csv:
        path: "{{ csv_filename }}"
        key: hostname
      register: csv_data

    - name: Create address objects
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_address_object:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        name: "{{ item.value.hostname }}"
        value: "{{ item.value.ip }}"
      with_items: "{{ csv_data.dict | dict2items }}"

    - name: Create a list of the address objects
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        address_objects_list: "{{ csv_data.dict | dict2items | map(attribute='key') | list }}"

    - name: Add address objects to address group
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_address_group:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        name: test_group
        static_value: "{{ address_objects_list }}"

    - name: Create a security rule
      paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_security_rule:
        provider: "{{ device }}"
        state: "present"
        rule_name: "Test rule"
        source_zone: ["any"]
        destination_zone: ["any"]
        source_ip: ["test_group"]
        source_user: ["any"]
        destination_ip: ["any"]
        application: ["ssh"]
        action: "allow"
```
