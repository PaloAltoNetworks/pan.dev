## Support

This solution is released under an as-is, best effort, support policy. This solution should be seen as community supported and Palo Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of this solution through our normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying products used by the solution are still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the solution itself.

Community support can be found within [the relevant section of the Palo Alto Networks Live Community](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/automation-api-discussions/bd-p/TechnologiesSDKsDiscussions).
