# IoT Security  

IoT Security is supported starting with App/Add-on 6.6.0.

IoT Security is cloud-hosted so logs are retrieved by Splunk using the IoT Security logging API. Logs are pulled down in JSON format with sourcetype="pan:iot_alert", sourcetype="pan:iot_device" and eventtype="pan_iot_device", eventtype="pan_iot_alert".

## Create API Key in IoT Security

Use the instruction in the IoT Security Administrator's Guide to gain API access:

[https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/iot/iot-security-api-reference/iot-security-api-overview/get-started-with-the-iot-security-api.html](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/iot/iot-security-api-reference/iot-security-api-overview/get-started-with-the-iot-security-api.html)

This action will provide you a **Key** and **Key ID**.  The Key be shown only once, so make sure to record it or you'll need to re-create the Key.

## Create IoT Security Input and add Key to Splunk

In Splunk, navigate to the **Palo Alto Networks Add-on**.

Within the Add-on, click the **Input** tab at the top left.  Then click **Create New Input** and select **IoT Security**.

In the dialog window, enter the following:

![](/splunk/img/iot-settings.png)

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Name | Any friendly name (eg. "iot_security") |
| Interval | Frequency in seconds to check for new logs (60 seconds recommended) |
| Index | The index in which to put the IoT Security logs |
| Customer ID | Found in the hostname when accessing IoT Security. (eg. https://customer-id.iot.paloaltonetworks.com) |
| Access Key ID | Enter Key ID |
| Secret Access Key | Enter Key |

Then click **Add** to save the modular input.

## Verify

After waiting the interval time, check that logs are coming into Splunk by clicking **Search** at the top and entering this search:

    eventtype="pan_iot_device"

You should see some JSON formatted logs show up. If nothing shows up, wait a little longer, ensure there is activity in IoT Security to generate logs, and try the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshoot).
