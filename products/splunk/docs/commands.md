# Searchbar Commands

There are several custom commands in the app that can communicate to the Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall to make changes. These commands take the events from the search as input, and add context the firewall so it can better enforce its security policy.

## panuserupdate

The `panuserupdate` command synchronizes user login events with Palo Alto Networks User-ID. More information: [User-ID with Splunk](/splunk/docs/userid)

Added in App version 5.0. For previous versions, refer to the [panupdate](/splunk/docs/commands#panupdate) command.

**Syntax**:

    panuserupdate device=<hostname>|panorama=<hostname>
                  [serial=<serial-of-device-in-panorama>] [vsys=<vsys#>]
                  [action=<login|logout>] [ip_field=<field-containing-IPs>]
                  user_field=<field-containing-usernames>

| Parameter   | Default | Usage                                                    |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| device      |         | IP or hostname of firewall                               |
| panorama    |         | IP or hostname of Panorama                               |
| serial      |         | Serial of firewall (required if using panorama parameter |
| vsys        | vsys1   | VSYS ID (eg. vsys2)                                      |
| action      | login   | Tell the firewall user logged in or logged out           |
| ip_field    | src_ip  | Log field containing IP address                          |
| user_field  | user    | Log field containing the username                        |

Example 1:  
When a radius authentication log is received by Splunk, tell the firewall that the user logged. This command would cause the firewall with management IP 192.168.4.211 to receive the user-to-IP mapping:

    index=main sourcetype=radius | panuserupdate device="192.168.4.211"

Example 2:  
The previous example assumes the user and ip are in fields named user and src_ip. If this is not the case, rename the fields or tell the command what fields to use.

Rename the fields:

    index=main sourcetype=radius | rename addr AS ip | rename authuser AS user | panuserupdate panorama="10.5.5.8" serial="0001A13800105"

Call out the fields:

    index=main sourcetype=radius | panuserupdate panorama="10.5.5.8" serial="0001A13800105" vsys="vsys4" ip_field="addr" user_field="authuser"

The first search renames the fields before passing them to the panuserupdate command. It also uses Panorama to connect to a firewall with the serial number 0001A13800105. This is the User-ID firewall connected to Panorama.

The second search tells the panuserupdate command which fields contain the ip and user. It also passes this information via Panorama to a firewall, but this example specifies the update is for vsys4 on the firewall.

Example 3:  
Notifies the firewall of a radius user logout via Panorama. The default fields src_ip and user are used to gather the IP and Username:

    sourcetype=radius logout | panuserupdate panorama="10.4.4.4" serial="0004001028200" action="logout"

## pantag

The `pantag` command shares context with the firewall by tagging IP addresses found in Splunk into [Dynamic Address Groups](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/70/pan-os/pan-os/policy/use-dynamic-address-groups-in-policy.html).

Command added in App version 4.1. New parameters added in App version 5.0.

**Syntax**:

    pantag device=<hostname>|panorama=<hostname>
           [serial=<serial-of-device-in-panorama>] [vsys=<vsys#>]
           [action=<add|remove>] [ip_field=<field-containing-IPs>]
           tag=<tag>|tag_field=<field-containing-tags>

| Parameter  | Default | Added in | Usage                                                          |
|------------|---------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| device     |         | 4.1      | IP or hostname of firewall                                     |
| panorama   |         | 5.0      | IP or hostname of Panorama                                     |
| serial     |         | 5.0      | Serial of firewall (required if using panorama parameter       |
| vsys       | vsys1   | 5.0      | VSYS ID (eg. vsys2)                                            |
| action     | addip   | 4.1      | addip, removeip, adduser, removeuser                           |
| field      | src_ip | 4.1      | Same as ip_field parameter (deprecated in 5.0, use ip_field) |
| ip_field  | src_ip | 5.0      | Log field containing IP address to tag                         |
| user_field  | src_ip | 6.5.0      | Log field containing user to tag                         |
| tag        |         | 4.1      | Tag for the IP, referenced in the Dynamic Address Group        |
| tag_field |         | 5.0      | Log field containing the tag for IP address in the same log    |

:::note

Prior to App version 5.0, the `ip_field` parameter is just `field`

:::

Example 1:  
Any IP on the network that generated a spyware (command-and-control traffic) alert is tagged as an infected host on the firewall at 10.1.1.1:

    `pan_threat` log_subtype="spyware" | stats dc(src_ip) by src_ip | pantag device="10.1.1.1" action="add" tag="infected-host"

In this example, any device that is sending command and control traffic will be tagged with infected-host. Your security policy could limit the reach of IP addresses with this tag until the incident is remediated. Or it could present a captive portal to the user indicating the problem and steps to contact IT.

Example 2:  
Tag any IP that is generating linux syslogs as a linux host on the firewall. Tag is applied to the firewall with serial 0005001028200 via the Panorama at 10.4.4.4:

    sourcetype="linux_messages_syslog" | pantag panorama="10.4.4.4" serial="0005001028200" ip_field="host" tag="linux-host"

Example 3:  
Tag every IP address on the firewall with their Splunk classification (from the IP classification lookup table):

    `pan_traffic` | pantag device="10.1.1.1" ip_field="src_ip" tag_field="src_class"

Example 4:  
If anyone tries to connect to www.splunk.com, remove the tag 'suspicious-ip-address' from the IP of the website. Tag is removed on vsys3 of firewall with hostname main-fw.company.com:

    `pan_url` dest_hostname="www.splunk.com" | pantag device="main-fw.company.com" vsys="vsys3" action="remove" ip_field="dest_ip" tag="suspicious-ip-addresses"

:::note

The IP is tagged on the firewall immediately, however, it can take up to 60 seconds for the tagged IP addresses to show up in the corresponding Dynamic Address Group in the security policy. This delay is intentional to prevent accidental DoS scenarios.

## pancontentpack

Update the app and threat lookup tables from the latest firewall content pack.

Added in App version 5.0

For usage instructions, see [Update metadata from content packs](/splunk/docs/lookups#contentpack).

## Legacy commands

### panblock

Deprecated in App version 4.1. Use [pantag](/splunk/docs/commands#pantag) instead.

Removed in App version 5.2.

Modify the configuration of the firewall address groups to include IP addresses from events in Splunk. This is similar to tagging IP addresses and works the same way, but is much less dynamic than tagging because it is modifying the firewall configuration and requires a configuration commit. :

    `index=pan_logs sourcetype=pan_threat log_subtype=vulnerability | stats dc (src_ip) by (src_ip) | panblock device="1.0.0.1" action="add" group="attackers"`

### panupdate

Deprecated in App version 5.0. Use [panuserupdate](/splunk/docs/commands#panuserupdate) instead.

Removed in App version 5.2.

The Palo Alto Networks firewall will inform Splunk of the user generating each connection via the syslogs it sends to Splunk. This assumes that the firewall is getting the login information from AD or some other authentication system, to know what user is logged into the device generating the traffic.

If authentication logs are being indexed by Splunk, then Splunk can share knowledge of where users are logged in to the firewall. For example, if Splunk is receiving a radius authentication log where 'user' is the field containing the user who authenticated, and 'ip' is the field containing the IP address where the user logged in, then you can map the user to the ip on the firewall using the `panupdate` command like so:

    `index=main sourcetype=radius | rename user AS addruser | rename ip AS addrip | panupdate device="192.168.4.211"`

This would cause the firewall with management IP 192.168.4.211 to receive the user-to-IP mapping. The mapping times out after 30 minutes.
