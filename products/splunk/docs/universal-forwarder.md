Syslog-ng and Universal Forwarder
=================================

This document assumes you already have syslog-ng, Splunk Universal Forwarder and Splunk installed and will not cover installation.

You should also have the Palo Alto Networks for Splunk Add-on installed as described in the [Installation Guide](../installation)

:::info

The App and Add-on do not need to be installed on the Universal Forwarder.

:::

## Step 1: Setup Syslog-ng

Add the following lines to the `/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf` file. This example uses the default install location of syslog-ng on an ubuntu server. Change the directory as need.

Under "Sources" add a source in syslog-ng to listen for logs on a port. This example uses port UDP 514:

    source s_udp514 { 
        network(
            transport("udp")
            port(514)
            flags(no-parse)
        );
    };

Under "Destinations" specify a .log file destination:

    destination d_udp514 { file("/YOURPATH/udp514.log" template("${MSG}\n")); };

Under "Log paths" specify the path of the log:

    log { source(s_udp514); destination(d_udp514); };

Save `syslog-ng.conf` and restart syslog-ng:

    $ /etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart

## Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder

Configure the Universal Forwarder to monitor the `/YOURPATH/udp514.log` file created in step 1.

Create or modify`/opt/splunkforwader/etc/system/local/inputs.conf` and add a monitoring stanza:

    [monitor:///YOURPATH/udp514.log]
    sourcetype = pan:log

Create or modify`/opt/splunkforwader/etc/system/local/outputs.conf` and add a tcpout stanza:

    [tcpout]
    defaultGroup = default-autolb-group

    [tcpout:default-autolb-group]
    server = 192.168.0.3:9997

    [tcpout-server://192.168.0.3:9997]

:::note

Replace the IP address 192.168.0.3 with the IP of Splunk indexer.

:::

To forward to multiple Splunk servers use this tcpout stanza instead:

    [tcpout]
    defaultGroup = default-autolb-group

    [tcpout:default-autolb-group]
    server = 192.168.0.1:9997,192.168.0.2:9997,192.168.0.3:9997
    [tcpout-server://192.168.0.1:9997]
    [tcpout-server://192.168.0.2:9997]
    [tcpout-server://192.168.0.3:9997]

Restart Splunk Universal Forwarder:

    $ /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart

## Step 3: Configure Splunk Indexer

If it doesn't exist, add a listening port on Splunk Indexer:

1.  From the Web Interface navigate to **Settings->;Forwarding and receiving**
2.  Under **Recieve Data**, click on **Configure receiving**
3.  If port 9997 is already listed then you are done
4.  Otherwise, click on **New**
5.  Add port 9997 to **Listen on this port**
6.  Click Save

## Step 4: Verify

Verify logs are being forwarded correctly by searching for the following: :

    source="/YOURPATH/udp514.log"

Change the source to the directory and file you are monitoring.

Verify that `sourcetype` is being transformed. You should see `pan:traffic` , `pan:system` , `pan:threat` , `pan:config` as the sourcetype.

If log `sourcetype` is `pan:log` then syslog-ng is changing the logs and they are not being transformed. Go back to step 1 and verify you made the correct changes.

:::info

If the Indexer has not been running and receiving for a lengthy period of time. It may take awhile for logs to show up.
