# Aperture

Aperture SaaS Security is supported starting with App/Add-on 6.0.0.

Aperture is cloud-hosted so logs are retrieved by Splunk using the Aperture logging API. Logs are pulled down in JSON format with sourcetype="pan:aperture" and eventtype="pan_aperture".

## Create a Client App in Aperture

Use the instruction in the Aperture Administrator's Guide to create a Client App in your Aperture instance:

[https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/aperture/aperture/aperture\_guide/aperture-syslog-and-api-integration/add-your-api-client-app-to-the-aperture-service](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/aperture/aperture/aperture_guide/aperture-syslog-and-api-integration/add-your-api-client-app-to-the-aperture-service)

This action will provide you a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.  The Client Secret will be shown only once, so make sure to record it or you'll need to re-create the Client App to get a new Client Secret.

## Add the credentials to Splunk

In Splunk, navigate to the **Palo Alto Networks Add-on**.

Once inside the Add-on, click the **Configuration** tab, and ensure you're on the **Account** tab.  Click **Add** in the top right corner to add new credentials.

In the dialog window, enter the following:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Account name | Any friendly account name (eg. "Aperture_creds") |
| Username | The Client ID |
| Password | The Client Secret |

Then click **Add** to save these credentials.

## Create an Aperture input in Splunk

Within the Add-on, click the **Inputs** tab at the top left. Then click **Create New Input** and then select **Aperture**.

Enter the settings for the Aperture input:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Name | Any friendly name (eg. "Aperture") |
| Interval | Frequency in seconds to check for new logs (60 seconds recommended) |
| Index | The index in which to put the Aperture logs |
| Global Account | The account you created in the previous step |

Click **Add** to save the Aperture input.

## Verify

After waiting the interval time, check that logs are coming into Splunk by clicking **Search** at the top and entering this search:

    eventtype="pan_aperture"

You should see some JSON formatted logs show up. If nothing shows up, wait a little longer, ensure there is activity in Aperture to generate logs, and try the [Troubleshooting Guide](/splunk/docs/troubleshoot#aperture).
