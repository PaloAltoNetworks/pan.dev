## Keep your repo up to date

- **`git clone`** - creates a local copy of the repository for you to work in

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/pan.dev.git
  ```

  Use this when you have not yet created a copy of the repo locally

- **`git pull`** pulls changes from repository you cloned and merges them into their respective branches

  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

  Use this when you want to grab changes that have been pushed to the repo you are working on and bring them locally

- **`git fetch`** reaches out to repository you cloned to ask if there are changes, does not merge them

  ```bash
  git fetch
  ```

  Use this to see if if there are changes without merging them

- **`git merge`** merges `branch-name` into your working branch

  ```bash
  git merge `branch-name`
  ```

  Use this to get your repo in sync with another branch.

  _caution this could result in a conflict, more on that later_

## Keep track of your work

- **`git checkout`** checkout a branch or create a new branch and check it out

  ```bash
  git checkout -b branch-name
  ```

  Use this to switch branches or create a new branch off of your current branch

- **`git branch`** see which branch you are working in and other available branches

  ```bash
  git branch
  ```

  Use this to keep track of where you are and which branches you have locally

- **`git status`** see all files with changes you've made in your working branch

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

  Use this to see what changes have been made (whether on purpose or accident)

- **`git add <filename>`** adds a file you've edited to be staged for a commit

  ```bash
  git add docs/contributing/git_basics
  ```

  Use `git status` to see which files have changed and `git add` to pull out only the files you want to commit. `git add .` will add all changed files.

  - **`git commit`** takes all staged files and bundles them into a commit

  ```bash
  git commit -m "summary of the commit"
  ```

  Use this to combine your changes and prepare to push for others

- **`git push`** takes a commit and pushes it to the repository

  ```bash
  git push origin branch-name
  ```

  Use this to push the changes to the repository where you can share them with others or merge them into the main branch
