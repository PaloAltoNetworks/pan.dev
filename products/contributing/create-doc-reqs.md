:::tip
The recommended way to add/edit content is, locally, using your favorite text editor (e.g. TextWrangler, VIM, etc.) or IDE (VSCode, Atom, etc.).
:::

#### Minimum Requirements

1.  **Node.js version >=16**

To see if you have node installed run the following:

```bash
node -v
```

If you don't have node, install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use your package installer of choice (e.g. Homebrew)

2. **Yarn version >=1.5**

To see if you have yarn installed run the following:

```bash
yarn --version
```

If you don't have yarn installed run the following:

```bash
npm install yarn --global
```

3. **Git CLI**

To see if you have git installed run the following:

```bash
git --version
```

If you dont have git installed, install it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

4. **An IDE or Code Editor**

We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you don't already have an editor of choice.

#### Now that you're environment is ready let's move on to setting up your development environment.
