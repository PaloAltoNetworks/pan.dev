Contributing a new document can be achieved with the following, high-level flow:

1. Create a new Markdown e.g. `your-doc-id.md` in the appropriate directory under the `docs` directory (or create a new directory)
2. Add the frontmatter (including the unique ID)
3. Add the document ID to an existing or new sidebar/sidebar category
4. Add the content

### Frontmatter

Each doc requires a frontmatter header at the top of the doc

Example:

```md
---
id: create-doc-add
title: Contributing a New Doc
sidebar_label: Add a New Doc
description: A really cool tutorial about adding a doc to pan.dev!
keywords:
  - awesome
  - tutorial
authors:
  - csestito
  - sserrata
  - blindaa121
---
```

- `id` is a unique id for your doc. It needs to have no spaces in it, and is used to create the URL your doc is at in combination with the directory your doc is in.
For example, this doc is in the `products/contributing` folder so it shows up at `pan.dev/contributing/create-doc-add`. To reference the doc in the sidebar you would refer to it as `contributing/your-doc-id`.
- `title` is what will be displayed at the top of the doc. In this doc you can see "Contributing a New Doc"
- `sidebar_label` is how you see the doc in the sidebar to the left (or if you click the menu in mobile view). This doc shows up at `Add a New Doc`
- `description` is used to summarize this doc. When you share links from pan.dev or see results on Google, they use the `description` to show users what the page contains. Otherwise, the content from the top of the doc will show up.
- `keywords` is used by search engines to better understand the content of the doc. Using keywords will help improve your SEO.
- `authors` is used to highlight who created/contributed to the doc. This field is optional. If you want to add authors, add 1 or many authors to the list by using Github account IDs. By default we link to your Github account and pull your Github avatar.
To modify your name, avatar, url and add a title visit the authors.json file in the root directory. Here you can create an entry for yourself. Here is my entry:
```json
"csestito": { //My Github ID. Can be found in the URL of your github account, mine is https://github.com/csestito.
    "name": "Charlie Sestito", // Using my name instead of Github ID
    "title": "DevRel at Palo Alto Networks", // A custom title
    "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/csestito/", // Linking to my LinkedIn instead of my Github
    "image_url": "/img/avatars/dev.png", // Use the static/img/avatars folder to hold your avatar, can't use external sources.
  },
```

There is a more advanced description of all possible front-matter options [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter).

:::note
If you're not sure where to begin, feel free to use an existing doc as boilerplate. Just remember that each document requires a unique ID.
:::

### Sidebar

The sidebar is generated from the `sidebars.js` file located in the root folder. Add your docs `id` along with path relative to the docs folder to the appropriate sidebar items.

```js {6,7}
module.exports = {
  cloud: [
    // Add your new doc inside an existing sidebar
    {
      type: "category",
      label: "Tutorials", // Category label
      items: ["tutorials/new-doc-id", "tutorials/your-doc-id"], // Document ID (including relative path after docs)
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Now you should see your doc in the sidebar in your browser (run `yarn start` if you aren't already). Next we'll see what you can do with Markdown
