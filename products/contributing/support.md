## PAN.dev Support

The software in this repository is released under an as-is, best-effort support policy. This software is community-supported; Palo Alto Networks will contribute expertise as and when possible.

We do not provide technical support, usage assistance, or troubleshooting for the components of this project through our standard support channels, such as:
- Palo Alto Networks Support Teams (TAC)
- Authorized Support Centers (ASC) partners
- Backline support options

The underlying products used may still be supported, but that support is strictly for core product functionality.

For issues specific to pan.dev, e.g. problems with in-site search or the functionality of the site itself, you may use the “Report an Issue” button to open a GitHub Issue. 

Please see the next section for matters relating to documentation and/or product support.

## Documentation & Product Support

While we strive for accuracy, please be advised that some issues may fall under our Paid Support Model. This includes situations where:
- Product or API documentation is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date.
- Troubleshooting is required to resolve discrepancies between this repository's content and official product specifications.

In these cases, support is available to you for registered devices with active support licenses. For more details on entitlements and how to open a formal case, please visit the [Palo Alto Networks Customer Support Plan page](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/services/support/customer-support-plan).

## Official Sources & Policies

Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub repository (at https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks) or sites other than our official Downloads page on https://support.paloaltonetworks.com are provided under the best-effort policy.
