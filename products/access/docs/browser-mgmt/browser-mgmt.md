Welcome to the Prisma Access Browser (PAB) APIs. These APIs are available for all PAB tenants to scale and automate their processes related to the browser.  
To know more, see Prisma Access Browser[https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access-browser]

**Note:**
  - The PAB APIs are accessible only in the U.S region. 
  - PAB's API can only work with the following pre-defined Roles: 
   - **Super User:** Full read/write access.

   - **View-Only Administrator:** Read-only access.

All of the functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the [Prisma Access Browser user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access-browser).


See the [Prisma SASE API Get Started](/sase/docs/getstarted) for information about base URLs, authentication, and obtaining access tokens.
After you obtain an [access token](/sase/docs/access-tokens),
you can use these APIs to configure your Prisma Access deployments.
