The Prisma Access Insights 2.0 APIs allow you to query your Prisma Access tenant for the health of
your Prisma Access network deployment. The 2.0 APIs are are intended for cloud-managed Prisma Access
customers, where the tenants have been onboarded by Palo Alto Networks using a Tenant Service Group
(TSG) identifier.

To validate your tenant ID go to the Prisma Access Hub, click on the Prisma Access Insights
application name, and look in the **Manage Apps** section.

To use 1.0 APIs, see [1.0 APIs](/access/api/insights/1.0).
