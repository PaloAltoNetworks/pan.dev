Welcome to the Prisma Access Browser (PAB) APIs. These APIs are available for all PAB tenants to
scale and automate their processes related to the browser.
For more information, see [Prisma Access Browser](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access-browser).

**Note:**
- The PAB APIs are accessible only in the U.S region.
- PAB APIs can only work with the following pre-defined Roles:
  - **Super User:** Full read/write access.
  - **View-Only Administrator:** Read-only access.


All of the functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the
[Prisma Access user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-cloud-managed-admin.html).

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
