Welcome to the Prisma Browser Management APIs. These APIs are available for all Prisma Browser tenants to scale and automate their processes related to  the browser.
For more information, see the [Prisma Browser](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access-browser)
product documentation.

**Note:**
Prisma Browser APIs can only work with the following pre-defined roles:
  - **Super User:** Full read/write access.
  - **View-Only Administrator:** Read-only access.


All of the functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the
[Strata Cloud Manager user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access-browser/administration/use-the-prisma-access-browser-dashboards).

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
