Welcome to the Prisma Access Browser (PAB) APIs. These APIs are available for all PAB tenants to
scale and automate their processes related to the browser.
For more information, see the [Prisma Access Browser](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access-browser)
product documentation.

**Note:**
PAB APIs can only work with the following pre-defined roles:
  - **Super User:** Full read/write access.
  - **View-Only Administrator:** Read-only access.


All of the functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the
[Strata Cloud Manager user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access-browser/administration/use-the-prisma-access-browser-dashboards).

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
