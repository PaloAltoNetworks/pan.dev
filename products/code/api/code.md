The Prismaâ„¢ Cloud Code Security API enables you to check your Infrastructure-as-Code resources against
Prisma Cloud out-of-the-box and custom security policies programmatically. The Code Security API
enables you to:

* Initiate Code Security scans of repositories you've added to Prisma Cloud
* View the repositories you've connected to Code Security
* Manage Code Security suppression rules
* Fix or suppress Code Security policy violations

 Use the [CSPM Policy API](/api/cloud/cspm/policy) to create and manage Code Security build policies.

See [Prisma Cloud Code Security](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security.html) for more information.

Check the status notifications at <https://status.paloaltonetworks.com/> for the Prisma Cloud release schedule to know when new functionality is available.
