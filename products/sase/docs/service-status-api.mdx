You can find a Palo Alto Networks SASE Status Page hosted at
https://sase.status.paloaltonetworks.com. Documentation for the companion API for this
Status Page is hosted at https://sase.status.paloaltonetworks.com/api, including a Javascript
wrapper.

The API itself is delivered using Atlassian's StatusPage offering. This API provides a collections of
endpoints which all return JSON formatted payloads. The API does not provide any built-in filtering;
any filtering or parsing of responses should be done client-side using a JSON
parsing library within your programming language of choice.
