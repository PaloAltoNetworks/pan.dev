You can make an API call to a SASE service when you have done all of the following:

1. Created at least one [TSG](/sase/docs/tenant-service-groups).
2. Created at least one [service account](/sase/docs/service-accounts).
3. Assigned a [role](/sase/docs/roles) to the service account.
4. Obtained an [access token](/sase/docs/access-tokens).

To make an API call, provide your access token on the request using the `Authorization` HTTP
header using the `Bearer` keyword.

For example, using curl:

    curl -o --location "https://api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com/config/v1/jobs" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"

## About x-panw-region ##

The [Aggregate Monitoring APIs](/sase/docs/mt-monitor/#x-panw-region-header-parameter)
require an additional `x-panw-region` header on their API calls to identify the region where your
data is stored. All other SASE services do not require this header because the information is
available in the access token that you use to authorize the call.

When making calls to the Aggregate Monitoring service, it is an error to not include
this header.

**NOTE:** It is an error to include the `x-panw-region` header on calls to a service that
does not require it.
