Authentication Service use roles to identify the access permissions that a user or
service account has to the resources provided by SASE. Each available
role is comprised of one or more permissions. Each permission grants some
kind of access (such as `read`) to a SASE service (such as Prisma Access
Config).

There is an API that you can use to [list all
roles](/sase/api/iam/get-iam-v-1-roles).
You can also view this information in the multitenant user interface.
Finally, you can look at [List of all Roles](/sase/docs/all-roles).

Similarly, there is an API that you can use to [list all permissions](/sase/api/iam/get-iam-v-1-permissions).

Both the list of roles and permissions will change over time as Prisma SASE
offers additional services and features.
