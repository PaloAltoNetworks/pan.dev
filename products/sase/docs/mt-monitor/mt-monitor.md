# Welcome to the Aggregate Monitoring APIs

Welcome to the Aggregate Monitoring APIs. These APIs are available to customers that utilize Cloud
Management for service onboarding, configuration, and operations.

After you [create a tenant service group](/sase/docs/tenant-service-groups),
[create a service account](/sase/docs/service-accounts),
and [obtain an access token](/sase/docs/access-tokens),
you can use the [Aggregate Monitoring API Reference](/sase/api/mt-monitor) to discover how to
perform aggregated monitoring queries for the following resources:

- [Data Resource API](/sase/api/mt-monitor/data-resource-api/): retrieve aggregated summaries and counts
  across all your tenants of a Prisma Access instance for threats, alerts, risky applications, URLs,
  and connectivity status.
- [Insights Resource API](/sase/api/mt-monitor/insights-resource-api/): retrieve an aggregated list of insights, such as all upgrade statuses across tenants.
- [License Resource API](/sase/api/mt-monitor/license-resource-api/): retrieve aggregated lists across
  Prisma Access tenants for license quotas, setup status, and utilization.
- [Tenant Resources API](/sase/api/mt-monitor/tenant-resources-api/): list all Prisma Access tenants in
  the hierarchy.

The monitoring functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the Prisma SASE Platform's
[Multitentant Portal user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform/monitor-tenants).

## Authentication

See the [Prisma SASE API Get Started](/sase/docs/getstarted) for information about base URLs, authentication, and obtaining access tokens.

## API Requests

Send all API requests to the base URL plus the path and parameter of
`/mt/monitor/v1/agg/<path>?<query_parameter>`.

For example, using curl:

    curl -X POST "https://api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com/mt/monitor/v1/agg/alerts/list?agg_by=tenant" \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-PANW-Region: de" \
    -d '{"properties":[{"property":"sub_tenant_id"},{"property":"total_count"}],"filter":{"operator":"AND","rules":[{"property":"domain","operator":"in","values":["External","external"]},{"property":"event_time","operator":"last_n_days","values":[7]}]}}'

Depending on the query and the [query parameter](/sase/docs/parameters), there are also [query
filters and properties](/sase/docs/filters) that you need to use in the request body.

This API requires the x-panw-region header. See [About x-panw-region](/sase/docs/api-call/#about-x-panw-region) for usage information.
