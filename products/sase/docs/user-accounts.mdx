User accounts are used to log into the Prisma SASE Multitenant Platform user interface so that the
user can perform administrative tasks on SASE products. User accounts are _not_ used for API access,
but you can perform some limited management of them using the Identity and Access Management APIs.

Two things must be true in order for a user to successfully perform administrative activites to SASE
products using the Prisma SASE Multitenant Platform:

1. The user must have a login account.
1. The login account must have been assigned one or more access policies that permit access to SASE
   products.

**Note:** There is no required order for these events. You can, for example, assign an access policy
for the user before a login account is available for that user. An email address is used to tie log
in accounts and access policies together. You just have to use the same email address for both
requirements to be successful.

## Log in accounts

A login account is required in order for the user to authenticate to the Prisma SASE Multitenant
Platform. There are different ways for a user to get a login account:

- If the user creates an account with Palo Alto Networks Customer Support, then a Palo Alto Networks
  SSO account is automatically created for the user during account creation.

- You can use the [SSO user creation API](/sase/api/iam/post-iam-v-1-sso-users)
  to create an Palo Alto Networks SSO account for the user.

- If your enterprise has an third party IDP integration with Palo Alto Networks, then an user account
  with your identity service provider will serve as a login account for the Prisma SASE Multitenant
  Platform.

You can check whether a user has a login account using the
[SSO user verification API](/sase/api/iam/get-iam-v-1-sso-users).

## Access Policies

As described in [Assign Roles](/sase/docs/roles-assign), you grant a user account access to
SASE products by [applying an access policy](/sase/api/iam/post-iam-v-1-access-policies)
to it. This is required in order for the authenticated user to perform any actions to
a SASE product.

When you assign an access policy to a user account, you use the email address which identifies that
user account. At the time of access policy assignment, the email address need not be associated with a
login account. If it is not, internal data structures are created within the Identity and Access
Management system to track the email address, but the login account is not actually created. Until
it is, the user cannot log into and use SASE products.
