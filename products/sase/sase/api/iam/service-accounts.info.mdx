# Service Accounts



Service accounts are used to obtain authentication tokens. As such, their use is required only
for API access to Prisma SASE services. You apply one or more [access policies](/sase/api/iam/accesspolicies)
to a service account to identify what roles the service account has, as well as what 
[TSGs](/sase/api/tenancy) 
the service account has access to.
