# Permissions



A single permission identifies an action that can be taken when you 
[grant a permission](/sase/api/iam/accesspolicies) 
to a user or service account. Permissions identify the resource
to which the permission applies, as well as the approved action (such as `read` or `write`).
Permissions are combined into [roles](/sase/api/iam/roles) for assignment to a user or service account
through the use of an [access policy](/sase/api/iam/accesspolicies).
