Welcome to the Strata Multitenant Cloud Manager Notification APIs. These APIs are designed to enable
the retrieval of notifications as well as the creation and management of notification profiles.
Utilize these APIs to efficiently manage and receive incidents, announcements, and Prisma Access
dataplane upgrades notifications across your tenant hierarchies. These APIs facilitate a unified
view of Strata Cloud Manager information and enable configurations for receiving notifications via
email or webhook. For more information about multitenant notifications, see 
[Manage Multitenant Notifications](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform/manage-multitenant-notifications)
in the 
[Strata Cloud Manager guide](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform).

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
