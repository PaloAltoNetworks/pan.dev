The rapid adoption of Enterprise 5G networks is transforming business operations across industries. With 5G connections expected to reach 1.4 billion by 2025 (GSMA Intelligence), ensuring comprehensive zero-trust security for user data across 5G-connected devices has become a critical concern for Service Providers (SPs) expanding their Enterprise 5G deployments.

Inadequate security measures in 5G networks can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and significant financial damage. Moreover, emerging regulations such as the EU's NIS2 Directive are mandating stronger cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure, including 5G networks.

Traditional embedded security solutions rely on hardware and software components placed in-line with the 5G core network for security enforcement. However, this approach presents scalability challenges, increases management complexity for SPs, and lacks multi-tenancy support. Additionally, these solutions struggle to support critical use cases such as 5G roaming and out-of-5G coverage scenarios.

On the other hand, Over-the-Top (OTT) SASE security solutions require an agent, proxy configurations (PAC files, certificates), or enterprise browsers to be installed on endpoint devices. This approach is not feasible for many 5G-connected devices, such as IoT devices, sensors, and robots. Moreover, OTT solutions rely on separate authentication and authorization mechanisms, which are not integrated with 5G network-based security frameworks, leading to fragmented security policy enforcement.

These challenges call for a new approach to Enterprise 5G security that addresses scalability, integration, and comprehensive policy enforcement across all devices and scenarios.


These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
