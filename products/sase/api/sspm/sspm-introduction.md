SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) APIs provide tools for continuous monitoring, detection of misconfigured SaaS application settings. 

### Why Use SSPM APIs?
Integrate SSPM APIs to:
- Monitor and manage security configurations.
- Ensure compliance with security best practices.

### Key Features
- Misconfiguration detection and prioritization.
- **Monitor SSPM Service and SaaS Integrations**: Track the health and status of the SSPM service and integrated SaaS applications, with real-time feature state monitoring and automated scans.

### How SSPM Works
1. **Discover SaaS Applications**: Onboard and monitor SaaS application.
2. **Analyze Configurations**: Fetch assessments and detect misconfigurations.
3. **Remediate Issues**: Resolve misconfigurations programmatically.
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Keep apps secure through automated monitoring.

### Prerequisites
- Access to SSPM.
- API token for authentication.

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
