Welcome to the Prisma SASE Multitenant Notification APIs. These APIs allows you to create and manage
notification profiles. You can then receive a consolidated view of the Strata Cloud Manager
announcements and Prisma Access dataplane upgrade information that you would otherwise see in various
places throughout the single tenant environment. For more information about multitenant
notifications, see [Manage Multitenant Notifications](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform/manage-multitenant-notifications) in the [Strata Cloud Manager guide](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform).


These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
