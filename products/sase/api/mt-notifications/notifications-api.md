Welcome to the Strata Multitenant Cloud Manager Notification APIs. These APIs allow you to create and manage
notification profiles. You can then receive a consolidated view of the Strata Cloud Manager incidents,
announcements, and Prisma Access dataplane upgrade information that you would otherwise see in various
places throughout the single tenant environment. You can also configure to receive notifications via email or webhook. For more information about multitenant notifications, see [Manage Multitenant Notifications](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform/manage-multitenant-notifications) in the [Strata Cloud Manager guide](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform).


These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
