Prisma Access ensures consistent security by enabling safe access to cloud and data center applications, as well as the internet, for users at headquarters, branch offices, or on the road. It inspects all traffic across all ports, providing secure access to the internet, sanctioned SaaS applications, public cloud environments, data centers, and headquarters. Built-in features include threat prevention, malware prevention, URL filtering, SSL decryption, and application-based policy capabilities, ensuring uniform security regardless of user location or accessed resources. All Prisma Access logs are stored in the Strata Logging Service for centralized analysis, reporting, and forensics across all users, applications, and locations.

Prisma Access offers scalable protection with global coverage, eliminating the need to size and deploy hardware firewalls at branches or manage appliances in colocation facilities. It provides the network infrastructure to connect remote branches, headquarters, data centers, and mobile users, without requiring you to build and manage your own global security infrastructure, thereby expanding your operational capacity.

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
