Welcome to the Strata Cloud Manager Multitenant Service Provider Interconnect APIs. The Service
Provider (SP) Interconnect API allows you to use Service Provider Backbones like BT, Orange, AT&T,
and more for directing Prisma Access egress traffic. Without the SP Interconnect, Prisma Access
egress traffic relies on public cloud providers like GCP, AWS, and Azure for network backbone
connectivity. The SP Interconnect API offers several benefits, including enhanced security,optimized
network costs, and reliability. You can easily manage traffic routing preferences on a per-SP and
per-Prisma Access location or region basis, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in network
operations. 

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
