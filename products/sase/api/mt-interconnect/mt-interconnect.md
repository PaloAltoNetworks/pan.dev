Welcome to the Strata Multitenant Cloud Manager SP Interconnect APIs. 
The SP Interconnect API allows you to use Service Provider (SP) Backbones like BT,Orange, AT&T, and more for directing Prisma Access egress traffic. Without the SP Interconnect, Prisma Access egress traffic relies on public cloud providers like GCP,AWS, and Azure for network backbone connectivity. The SP Interconnect API offers several benefits, including enhanced security,optimized network costs, and realibility. You can easily manage traffic routing preferences on a per-SP and per-Prisma Access location or region basis, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in network operations. 

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
