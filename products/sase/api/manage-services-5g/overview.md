The SASE 5G Manage Services offers a revolutionary approach to securing 5G networks, providing a scalable, agentless, and network-aware security framework that seamlessly integrates with existing 5G infrastructure.

Our goal is to make 5G networks secure and easy to manage. We provide Service Providers with powerful tools to protect data, support many devices, and offer top-notch security services to their business customers.

### Key Features & Advantages

1.  **Scalability Beyond 5G Core**
    * Security enforcement is decoupled from the 5G core network, eliminating the need for embedded security solutions.
    * Reduces operational complexity for Service Providers.
    * Example: A large manufacturing company can securely connect thousands of IoT sensors without impacting 5G core performance.

2.  **Seamless Integration with 5G Authentication and Authorization**
    * Uses 5G network-based authentication and authorization instead of separate OTT security mechanisms.
    * Enables unified security policy enforcement across all enterprise users and devices.

3.  **Multi-Tenancy Support**
    * Designed to support multiple enterprises within a single 5G network.
    * Allows Service Providers to offer security as a managed service for different customers.
    * Example: A Service Provider can offer tailored security policies for a hospital, a bank, and a retail chain, all within the same 5G infrastructure.

4.  **No Additional Software or Agent Required**
    * Does not require agent installation, proxies, or enterprise browsers.
    * Ideal for IoT devices, sensors, and robots where software installation is impractical.

5.  **Support for 5G Roaming and Out-of-Coverage Use Cases**
    * Ensures security enforcement even when devices are roaming across different 5G networks.
    * Provides security policies even when devices are outside 5G network coverage.

6.  **Unified Security Policy Definition and Enforcement**
    * Service Providers can define and enforce consistent security policies across all enterprise users and devices.
    * Eliminates security gaps caused by fragmented authentication mechanisms in OTT solutions.

### Integration Capabilities
The SASE 5G Manage Services seamlessly integrates with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems, identity providers, and threat intelligence platforms, enabling a holistic security approach.

### Conclusion
The SASE 5G Manage Services offers a scalable, multi-tenant, agentless, and network-aware security approach. It integrates directly with 5G network authentication frameworks, eliminating the need for complex in-line security appliances or OTT-based solutions.

By leveraging this solution, Service Providers can provide enterprise-wide 5G security as a managed service, ensuring a zero-trust security model without compromising scalability, flexibility, or ease of management. This positions SPs at the forefront of secure 5G enterprise services, opening new revenue streams and enhancing their value proposition in the rapidly evolving 5G landscape.
