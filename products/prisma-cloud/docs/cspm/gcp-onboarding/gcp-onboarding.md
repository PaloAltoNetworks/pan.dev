To enable Prisma Cloud to retrieve data on your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources and identify potential security risks and compliance issues, you must connect your GCP accounts to Prisma Cloud. Onboarding a GCP account, such as GCP project, GCP Organization, GCP MasterServiceAccount, or GCP Workspace on Prisma Cloud connects all the respective GCP resources to Prisma Cloud.

For automating GCP cloud account onboarding, see:
