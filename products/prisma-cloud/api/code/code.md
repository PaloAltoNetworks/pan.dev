The Prismaâ„¢ Cloud Application Security API enables you to check your Infrastructure-as-Code resources against
Prisma Cloud out-of-the-box and custom security policies programmatically. The Application Security API
enables you to:

- Initiate Application Security scans of repositories you've added to Prisma Cloud
- View the repositories you've connected to Application Security
- Manage Application Security suppression rules
- Fix or suppress Application Security policy violations

Use the [CSPM Policy API](/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/policy) to create and manage Application Security build policies.

See [Prisma Cloud Application Security](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security.html) for more information.

Check the status notifications at <https://status.paloaltonetworks.com/> for the Prisma Cloud release schedule to know when new functionality is available.
