The Prisma SD-WAN unified APIs allow you to integrate Prisma SD-WAN into your existing applications
and workflows. These APIs use the common SASE authentication and request mechanism for service
access and authorization. See the [Prisma SASE Get Started](/sase/docs/getstarted) for more information.
