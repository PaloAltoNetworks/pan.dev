The Prisma SD-WAN legacy APIs allow you to integrate Prisma SD-WAN into your existing applications
and workflows. These legacy APIs are identical to the APIs that existed prior to the availability of
the unified SASE APIs on June 6, 2022.

To get started with these APIs, see
[Prisma SD-WAN Legacy API Get Started](/sdwan/docs/legacy_getstarted).
