Welcome to the configuration Security Services APIs. You can use these APIs to define how you want
to [enforce platform traffic](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/strata-cloud-manager/getting-started/manage-configuration-ngfw-and-prisma-access/security-services).

These APIs use the [common authentication mechanism](/scm/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.

You must use the [Configuration Operations API](/scm/api/config/sase/operations/operations-api) to push
configurations made using these APIs to your deployments.
