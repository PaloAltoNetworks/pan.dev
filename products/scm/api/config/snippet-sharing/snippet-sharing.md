Welcome to the configuration Snippet Sharing APIs For Strata Cloud Manager and Prisma Access.

These APIs use the [common authentication mechanism](/scm/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.

You must use the [Configuration Operations API](/scm/api/config/cloudngfw/operations/operations-api-cloud-ngfw) to push
configurations made using these APIs to your deployments.
