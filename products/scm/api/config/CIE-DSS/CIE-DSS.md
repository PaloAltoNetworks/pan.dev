??? Add your description???

For details on Strata Cloud Manager Identity Services, see
[Manage: Identity Services](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/strata-cloud-manager/getting-started/manage-configuration-ngfw-and-prisma-access/identity-services)

These APIs use the [common authentication mechanism](/scm/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.

You must use the [Configuration Operations API](/scm/api/config/cloudngfw/operations/operations-api-cloud-ngfw) to push
configurations made using these APIs to your deployments.
