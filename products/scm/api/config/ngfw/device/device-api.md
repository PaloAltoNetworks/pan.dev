Welcome to the Device configuration APIs. Use these APIs to configure devices
your NGFW deployments. 

These APIs use the [common authentication mechanism](/scm/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.

You must use the [Configuration Operations API](/scm/api/config/ngfw/operations/operations-api-ngfw) to push
configurations made using these APIs to your deployments.
