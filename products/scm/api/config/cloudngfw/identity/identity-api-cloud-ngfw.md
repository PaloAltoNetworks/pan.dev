Welcome to the Configuration Identity APIs for Cloud-hosted Next Generation Firewalls (Cloud NGFW).
You can use these APIs to manage your identity services so that only certain users can access the
right data on your network.

For details on Strata Cloud Manager Identity Services, see
[Manage: Identity Services](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/strata-cloud-manager/getting-started/manage-configuration-ngfw-and-prisma-access/identity-services)

These APIs use the [common authentication mechanism](/scm/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.

You must use the [Configuration Operations API](/scm/api/config/cloudngfw/operations/operations-api-cloud-ngfw) to push
configurations made using these APIs to your deployments.
