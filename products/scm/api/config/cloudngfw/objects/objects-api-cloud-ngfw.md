Welcome to the Objects configuration APIs for Cloud-hosted Next Generation Firewalls (Cloud NGFW).
Objects are policy building blocks that group discrete identities such as IP addresses, URLs,
applications, or users. You can use these APIs to create and manage these objects.

For more information, see [Manage: Objects](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/strata-cloud-manager/getting-started/manage-configuration-ngfw-and-prisma-access/objects).

These APIs use the [common authentication mechanism](/scm/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.

You must use the [Configuration Operations API](/scm/api/config/cloudngfw/operations/operations-api-cloud-ngfw) to push
configurations made using these APIs to your deployments.
