# pan-os-go (Go)

The ```pan-os-go``` SDK helps interact with PAN-OS devices, and also serves as the underlying client library for the [PAN-OS Terraform provider](../../terraform/panos/docs/).

Documentation for this SDK can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pango#section-documentation). Of particular interest is the [example usage](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pango#pkg-examples) section, including use cases like [creating address groups](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pango#example-package-CreateAddressGroup), and [performing commits](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pango#example-package-FirewallCommit).
