# PAN-OS Upgrade Assurance

The `panos-upgrade-assurance` includes the set of libraries written in `Python` to ease the process of writing checks and state snapshots during PanOS upgrade on the Next Generation Firewall.

Both checks and snapshots can be used to verify the state of a device during an upgrade process. What more, it is possible to generate a report for these checks.

The libraries were written to support Ansible and XSOAR integrations. They depend on [pan-os-python](/panos/docs/panospython/) libraries and therefore are quite easy to fit into the [PAN-OS Ansible modules collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/paloaltonetworks/panos). Equivalent yaml configurations are provided in the documentation as a reference to use with the PAN-OS Ansible modules collection.

The libraries are available in two form factors:

- a python package hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/panos-upgrade-assurance/) repository
- a docker image hosted on [GHCR](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-upgrade-assurance/pkgs/container/panos_upgrade_assurance)
