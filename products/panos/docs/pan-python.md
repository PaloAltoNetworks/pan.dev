# pan-python (Python)

The `pan-python` SDK is a set of powerful, low-level Python packages for interacting with PAN-OS, WildFire, AutoFocus and more. It is also part of the underpinnings of the [PAN-OS Ansible collection](/ansible/docs/panos/).

Where [`pan-os-python`](./pan-os-python.md) provides an object-oriented framework to interact with PAN-OS appliances, `pan-python` is more low-level, providing a framework to interact with PAN-OS appliances with XML and Xpath defined operations, commands and configuration.

Documentation for this SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinsteves/pan-python/blob/master/doc/panxapi.rst) within the [repository for `pan-python`](https://github.com/kevinsteves/pan-python).

An [interactive lab](http://api-lab.paloaltonetworks.com/) is also provided for `pan-python`, which includes making configuration changes and performing User-ID operations amongst other topics.
