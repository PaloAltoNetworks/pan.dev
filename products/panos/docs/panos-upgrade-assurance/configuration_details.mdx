# Configuration details

This documentation represents the current state of the available checks and snapshot state areas, along with the instructions on how to configure them properly.

## Passing configuration in general

For most use cases, all checks, snapshots and reports (entities in general) are triggered by a common method, which:

- takes a list of checks, snapshots, reports (entities) that one would like to run,
- does initial list verification,
- picks up a proper method to run a specific entity,
- aggregates and presents the results in a form of a dictionary, where keys represent requested entities.

The list of entities can be just a list, but it can also follow the [`ConfigParser`][cfgprs] [`dialect`][dialect]. For more details, refer to the dialect's documentation. The most important is that this dialect supports two types of elements in the list: `str` and `dict`, where:

- `str` represents just an entity name such as a check, snapshot or report to run,
- `dict` (always single key:value pair allowed) represents the element name (key) and additional configuration (value) that will be passed to the method matching the particular element. This configuration is also passed as `dict`.

In the next sections of this documentation, the following aspects are covered:

- a common method with full configuration (where applicable),
- each entity available in a particular section with some basic information and a link to a method that is actually run. For details, see documentation for methods.

:::note
Each entity is documented under its own section where the section name is the entity name.

## Readiness checks

Readiness checks represent checks that are `boolean` in nature. A result of such checks always presents a `True`/`False` value with some explanation in case of check fails. They can be triggered with a common method: [`CheckFirewall.run_readiness_checks()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall#checkfirewallrun_readiness_checks). When running this method, a list of readiness checks to run (with an optional configuration) is provided using the `checks_configuration` parameter. This list is defined using the [`ConfigParser`][cfgprs] class [`dialect`][dialect]. For details, refer to the documentation for this class.

Elements of this list can be either of the `str` or `dict` type:

- `str` - the element simply specifies the name of a check to run.
- `dict` - the element contains the check name and a configuration (if a particular check requires one); the dictionary format is as follows:

  ```yaml
  {
    'check_name': {
      'config_name': 'config_value'
      'config2_name': 'config2_value'
    }
  }
  ```

Following [`ConfigParser's`][cfgprs] [`dialect`][dialect], when no configuration is provided, **all** checks are triggered. *Notice* that in this situation checks that require configuration to run will return [`CheckStatus.SKIPPED`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/utils#class-checkstatus).

Example of the `checks_configuration` parameter:

``` yaml
[
  'all',
  '!ha',
  {'content_version': {'version': '8634-7678'}}
]
```

This is interpreted as:

- run all checks
- except for the HA status verification
- override the Content DB version check to check for the minimum version of `8634-7678`.

The [`CheckFirewall.run_readiness_checks()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall#checkfirewallrun_readiness_checks) take one more parameter: `report_style`. Format of the returned data depends on the value of this parameter. If the value is:

- `False` (default): results of executed checks are formatted as `dict`, where keys are check names as passed in `checks_configuration` and values are dictionaries containing two keys:

  - `state`: a `bool` representation of the [`CheckResult`][chckres] class for a particular check.
  - `reason`:  a `str` representation of the [`CheckResult`][chckres] class for a particular check.

    Assuming that we run the checks with the following configuration:

    ``` yaml
    [
        'ha',
        'panorama',
    ]
    ```

    The return `dict` should look as follows:

    ``` yaml
    {
        'ha': {
            'state': False
            'reason': '[FAIL] Device configuration is not synchronized between the nodes.'
        }
        'candidate_config': {
            'state': True
            'reason': '[SUCCESS]'
        }
    }
    ```

- `True`: results are also formatted as `dict` with the keys corresponding to checks names, but values are a string representations of the [`CheckResult`][chckres] class.

  For the above example of checks, the result would be similar to:

  ``` yaml
  {
      'ha': '[FAIL] Device configuration is not synchronized between the nodes.'
      'candidate_config': '[SUCCESS].'
  }
  ```

The list of checks to run looks as follows:

```python
[
  "active_support",
  'candidate_config',
  'expired_licenses',
  'ntp_sync',
  'panorama',
  # tests below have optional configuration
  {
    "certificates_requirements": {
      "ecdsa": {"hash_method": "sha512"},
      "rsa": {
        "key_size": 1024,
        "hash_method": "sha1"
      }
    }
  },
  {'content_version': {'version': '8634-7678'}},
  {"expired_licenses": {"skip_licenses": ["Threat Prevention"]}},
  {'free_disk_space': {'image_version': '10.1.6-h6'}},
  {'ha': {'skip_config_sync': True}},
  {'planes_clock_sync': {'diff_threshold': 30}}
  # tests below require additional configuration
  {'arp_entry_exist': {'ip': '10.0.1.1'} },
  {'ip_sec_tunnel_status': {
    'tunnel_name': 'ipsec_tun'
  }},
  {'session_exist': {
    'source': '134.238.135.137',
    'destination': '10.1.0.4',
    'dest_port': '80'

}
```

## State snapshots

State snapshots store information about the state of a particular device area. They do not take any configurations. They store every possible information about an area. Use reports or custom code to extract a subset of information if required.

They can be triggered using a common method: [`CheckFirewall.run_snapshots()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall#checkfirewallrun_snapshots). When running this method a list of state areas is provided using the `snapshot_config` paramter. This list is specified in [`ConfigParser`][cfgprs] class [`dialect`][dialect]. For details, refer to the documentation for this class.

Following that [`dialect`][dialect], when no list is passed, **all** state snapshots are made.

The output of the [`CheckFirewall.run_snapshots()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall#checkfirewallrun_snapshots) method is formatted as a dictionary where:

- keys are state areas as passed in `snapshot_config` parameter,
- values are dictionaries with the actual data. Each dictionary can have a different structure. The structure depends on the nature of data we want to capture (see sections below for details).

The sample output containing a snapshot for *route tables*, *licenses*, and *IPSec tunnels* is shown below (one element per each area):

```json
{
  "ip_sec_tunnels": {
    "ipsec_tun": {
      "peerip": "10.26.129.5",
      "name": "ipsec_tun",
      "outer-if": "ethernet1/2",
      "gwid": "1",
      "localip": "0.0.0.0",
      "state": "init",
      "inner-if": "tunnel.1",
      "mon": "off",
      "owner": "1",
      "id": "1"
    },
  }.
  "routes": {
    "default_0.0.0.0/0_ethernet1/3": {
      "virtual-router": "default",
      "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
      "nexthop": "10.26.129.129",
      "metric": "10",
      "flags": "A S",
      "age": null,
      "interface": "ethernet1/3",
      "route-table": "unicast"
    },
  },
  "license": {
    "DNS Security": {
      "feature": "DNS Security",
      "description": "Palo Alto Networks DNS Security License",
      "serial": "007257000334668",
      "issued": "November 08, 2022",
      "expires": "November 01, 2023",
      "expired": "no",
      "base-license-name": "PA-VM",
      "authcode": null
    },
  }
}
```

Following state areas are available:

```yaml
[
  'nics',
  'routes',
  'license',
  'arp_table',
  'content_version',
  'session_stats',
  'ip_sec_tunnels',
]
```

Please see the sections below for details of each state snapshot:

### `arp_table`

Makes a snapshot of ARP table.

**Method:** [`FirewallProxy.get_arp_table()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#firewallproxyget_arp_table)

### `content_version`

Grabs the currently installed Content DB version.

**Method:** [`CheckFirewall.get_content_db_version()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall#checkfirewallget_content_db_version)

### `ip_sec_tunnels`

Takes a snapshot of configuration of all IPSec tunnels along with their state.

**Method:** [`CheckFirewall.get_ip_sec_tunnels()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall#checkfirewallget_ip_sec_tunnels)

### `license`

Takes a snapshot of information about all licenses installed on a device.

**Method:** [`FirewallProxy.get_licenses()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#firewallproxyget_licenses)

### `nics`

Takes a snapshot of a state of all configured (not installed) network interfaces.

**Method:** [`FirewallProxy.get_nics()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#firewallproxyget_nics)

### `routes`

Takes a snapshot of the Route Table (this includes routes populated from DHCP as well as manually entered ones).

**Method:** [`FirewallProxy.get_routes()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#firewallproxyget_routes)

### `session_stats`

Gets information about the session statistics, such as current sessions count per a session type (TCP, UDP, etc).

**Method:** [`FirewallProxy.get_session_stats()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#firewallproxyget_session_stats)

## Reports

The reporting part is actually the result of comparison of two snapshots. It is advised to run reports using the common method as some of the comparison results are calculated with it. The common method is: [`SnapshotCompare.compare_snapshots()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcomparecompare_snapshots).

Each report can be run with default or custom configuration. The following example shows reports with additional configuration (where applicable):

```python showLineNumbers
[
  {'ip_sec_tunnels: {
    'properties': ['state']
  }},
  {'arp_table': {
    'properties': ['!ttl'],
    'count_change_threshold': 10
  }},
  {'nics': {
    'count_change_threshold': 10
  }},
  {'license': {
    'properties': ['!serial']
  }},
  {'routes: {
    'properties': ['!flags'],
    'count_change_threshold': 10
  }},
  'content_version',
  {'session_stats': {
    'thresholds': [
      {'num-max': 10},
      {'num-tcp': 10},
    ]
  }}
]
```

For most reports, a generic comparison method is used ([`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold)). It produces the standardized dictionary. For details, see documentation for this method. Common method assigns a report result to a report area providing a dictionary where keys are report areas and values are report results.

For details on which configuration can be passed, check each report area below (for each report, we will explain the above-mentioned configuration):

### `arp_table`

Runs comparison of ARP tables snapshots.

**Method:** [`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold)

**Configuration parameters**

parameter | description
--- | ---
`properties` | (optional) a set of properties to skip when comparing two ARP table entries, all properties are checked when this parameter is skipped
`count_change_threshold` | (optional) maximum difference percentage of changed entries in ARP table in both snapshots, skipped when this property is not specified

**Sample configuration**

The following configuration:

- compares ARP table entries between both snapshots, but when comparing two entries the `ttl` parameter is not taken into consideration,
- calculates the count of changed ARP table entries from both snapshots and marks comparison as failed if the difference is bigger than 10%.

This report produces the standardized dictionary.

```python showLineNumbers
{
  'properties': ['!ttl'],
  'count_change_threshold': 10
}
```

### `content_version`

This is one of a few checks that does not take any configuration. It simply compares Content DB version from both snapshots. Results are presented as the standardized dictionary.

**Method:** [`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold)

### `ip_sec_tunnels`

Compares configuration and the state of IPSec tunnels.

**Method:** [`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold)

**Configuration parameters**

parameter | description
--- | ---
`properties` | (optional) a set of properties to skip when comparing two IPSec tunnels, all properties are checked when this parameter is skipped
`count_change_threshold` | (optional) maximum difference percentage of changed entries in IPSec tunnels in both snapshots, skipped when this property is not specified

**Sample configuration**

The following configuration compares the state of IPSec tunnels as
captured in snapshots.

This report produces the standardized dictionary.

```python showLineNumbers
{
  'properties': ['state']
}
```

### `license`

Compares installed licenses. This report does not only check if we have the same set of licenses in both snapshots but also compares license details, such as expiration date, etc.

**Method:** [`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold)

**Configuration parameters**

parameter | description
--- | ---
`properties` | (optional) a set of properties to skip when comparing two licenses, all properties are checked when this parameter is skipped
`count_change_threshold` | (optional) maximum difference percentage of changed licenses in both snapshots, skipped when this property is not specified

**Sample configuration**

Following configuration is set to compare licenses as captured in
snapshots. It will ignore the `serial` property.

This report produces the standardized dictionary.

```python showLineNumbers
{
  'properties': ['!serial']
}
```

### `nics`

Provides a report on status of network interfaces. This report is limited to information about network interfaces available in the snapshots. See the [`nics_snapshot`](#nics) snapshot information for details.

At the moment of writing this documentation, the snapshot contains only interface state information. Despite the fact that we use the generic method for preparing this report, the only reasonable parameter to use is `count_change_threshold`.

**Method:** [`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold)

**Configuration parameters**

parameter | description
--- | ---
`count_change_threshold` | (optional) maximum difference percentage of changed network interfaces in both snapshots, skipped when this property is not specified

**Sample configuration**

The following configuration provides both: change in NICs\' state (implicitly) and maximum difference in NICs count (fail threshold is 10%).

This report produces the standardized dictionary.

```python showLineNumbers
{
  'count_change_threshold': 10
}
```

### `routes`

Provides a report on differences between Route Table entries. It includes:

- availability of a route in one of the snapshots,
- for routes available in two snapshots, difference in route properties, such as age, next hop, etc.

**Method:** [`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold)

**Configuration parameters**

parameter | description
--- | ---
`properties` | (optional) a set of properties to skip when comparing two routes, all properties are checked when this parameter is skipped
`count_change_threshold` | (optional) maximum difference percentage of changed entries routes in both snapshots, skipped when this property is not specified

**Sample configuration**

The following configuration:

- compares Route Table entries between both snapshots, but when comparing two entries the `flags` parameter is not taken into consideration,
- calculates the count of changed Route Table entries from both snapshots and marks comparison as failed if the difference is bigger than 10%.

This report produces the standardized dictionary.

```python showLineNumbers
{
  'properties': ['!flags'],
  'count_change_threshold': 10
}
```

### `session_stats`

This report is slightly different than reports made with the [`SnapshotCompare.get_diff_and_threshold()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_diff_and_threshold) method as the snapshot data is different (refer to the [`FirewallProxy.get_session_stats()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#firewallproxyget_session_stats) method documentation for details).

It takes one parameter only: `thresholds`. It contains a list of sessions stats as available in the snapshot. For each stat a threshold value is provided. This report calculates a change in the session statistics and compares it to the threshold value. This parameter does not have a default value - when skipped the report gives no results.

**Method:** [`SnapshotCompare.get_count_change_percentage()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_count_change_percentage)

**Configuration parameters**

parameter | description
--- | ---
`thresholds` | a list of sessions with change threshold value to analyze

**Sample configuration**

The following configuration compares only stats for `num-max` and `num-tcp`. For both, the accepted difference is 10%.

This report produces a `dict` as documented in the [`SnapshotCompare.get_count_change_percentage()`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#snapshotcompareget_count_change_percentage) method documentation.

```python showLineNumbers
{
  'thresholds': [
    {'num-max': 10},
    {'num-tcp': 10},
  ]
}
```
