# Usage Examples

## Importing Classes

To use **PAN-OS Upgrade Assurance** in a project, you may either:

- import the package as a whole:

  ```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
  ```

  ```python showLineNumbers
  import panos_upgrade_assurance
  ```

  ```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  ```

- or be more specific about which modules you want to import:

  ```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
  ```

  ```python showLineNumbers
  from panos_upgrade_assurance import firewall_proxy
  from panos_upgrade_assurance import check_firewall
  from panos_upgrade_assurance import snapshot_compare
  from panos_upgrade_assurance import utils
  ```

  ```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  ```

- or, be even *more* specific by importing a specific class:

  ```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
  ```

  ```python showLineNumbers
  from panos_upgrade_assurance.check_firewall import CheckFirewall
  ```

  ```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  ```

## Initializing objects

In the following code snippets, we assume the 3<sup>rd</sup> way of importing the classes.

### `FirewallProxy` class

This class inherits the constructor method from the [Pan-OS-Python Firewall](https://pandevice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module-firewall.html) class. Therefore, objects for this class are initialized in the same way. For details, see documentation for this class. Here we will provide only the most basic way of initializing the [`FirewallProxy`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#class-firewallproxy) class that includes a username/password authentication.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

```python showLineNumbers
from panos_upgrade_assurance.firewall_proxy import FirewallProxy

firewall = FirewallProxy(
  hostname='FQDN or an IP address of the management interface',
  api_username='an account name, can be readonly',
  api_password='a password'
)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### `CheckFirewall` class

Since this is a *high level* class, it depends on the [`FirewallProxy`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#class-firewallproxy) class for device communication. Hence, the constructor for this class takes an object of the [`FirewallProxy`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/firewall_proxy#class-firewallproxy) class.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

```python showLineNumbers
from panos_upgrade_assurance.check_firewall import CheckFirewall
from panos_upgrade_assurance.firewall_proxy import FirewallProxy

firewall = FirewallProxy(hostname='1.2.3.4', api_username='ro_admin', api_password='************')
checks = CheckFirewall(firewall)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### `SnapshotCompare` class

This class provides methods of comparing two snapshots made with the
[`CheckFirewall`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall#class-checkfirewall) class. Therefore, it is an *offline* class - no communication with a device is made.

The idea around this class is that an object represents an entity storing two snapshots, for example, a pre-upgrade and a post-upgrade one. Therefore, the constructor takes two snapshots as input parameters. After an object is initialized, one can run reports on it. Each report is configurable but limited to data from both snapshots. In order to compare a different set of snapshots, one has to create a new object.

In the example above, we implicitly take snapshots for all supported state areas. For more details, see [`ConfigParser`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/utils#class-configparser) [`dialect`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/dialect).

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

```python showLineNumbers
from panos_upgrade_assurance.snapshot_compare import SnapshotCompare

diff_object = SnapshotCompare( # initialize object storing both snapshots
  left_snapshot=snapshot1,     # 1st snapshot
  right_snapshot=snapshot2     # 2nd snapshot
)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### `ConfigParser` class (internal)

Although this is an internally used class, probably not often used on a daily basis, we provide documentation on how to initialize it as it's heavily used in the other classes.

The constructor for this class takes two arguments:

- a valid set of configuration parameters,
- a configuration provided by a user (the one that will be verified and parsed).

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

```python showLineNumbers
from panos_upgrade_assurance.utils import ConfigParser

parser = ConfigParser(
  requested_config=[]   # a list of configuration elements
  valid_elements=[]     # a list of all valid elements
)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## The library in action - usage examples

Please note that the samples below assume the minimum knowledge on available tests and their configurations. Refer to the [Configuration Details document](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/configuration-details) for complete documentation.

### Running readiness checks for a single device

This is the sample code showing how to run readiness checks. In this example, we run two critical checks on a device after an upgrade is done:

- `session_exist` check makes sure that a session described with `source`, `destinations`, and `dest_port` parameters is present in the device sessions table,
- `arp_entry_exist` check looks for an entry in the ARP table matching a given `ip` address.

If at least one of the tests fail, the script exits immediately.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

```python showLineNumbers
from panos_upgrade_assurance.check_firewall import CheckFirewall
from panos_upgrade_assurance.firewall_proxy import FirewallProxy

# ... upgrade code goes here

firewall = FirewallProxy(hostname='1.2.3.4', api_username='ro_admin', api_password='************')
checks = CheckFirewall(firewall)

checks_configuration = [
  { 'session_exist': {
      'source': '123.234.123.234',
      'destination': '10.0.0.1',
      'dest_port': '8080'
  }},
  { 'arp_entry_exist': {
      'ip': '10.100.0.1'
  }},
]

results = checks.run_readiness_checks(checks_configuration)

passed = True

for check in checks_configuration:
  check_name = list(check.keys())[0]
  passed = passed & results[check_name]['state']

  if not results[check_name]['state']:
    print(f'FAILED: {check_name} - {results[check_name]["reason"]}')

if not passed:
  exit(1)

# ... continue script
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The sample output of this portion of the script (both tests fail):

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="output" label="Output" default>
```

```console showLineNumbers
FAILED: session_exist - [FAIL] Session not found in the session table.
FAILED: arp_entry_exist - [FAIL] Entry not found in the ARP table.
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Generating a report based on snapshots

In this example, we take two snapshots (one for each device in an HA pair) and we use the [`SnapshotCompare`](/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare#class-snapshotcompare) class to compare licenses. Based on the comparison result, a decision is made whether to continue with the rest of the script.

The comparison itself is configured to:

- skip two properties (to avoid false-positives):
  - `serial` as serial numbers for both devices are different,
  - `authcodes` as two different authcodes were used for licensing devices.
- check only part of the comparison results that compares licenses existing in both snapshots. Licenses missing in each snapshot are not checked.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

```python showLineNumbers
from panos_upgrade_assurance.check_firewall import CheckFirewall
from panos_upgrade_assurance.firewall_proxy import FirewallProxy
from panos_upgrade_assurance.snapshot_compare import SnapshotCompare
from panos_upgrade_assurance.utils import printer


node_a    = FirewallProxy(hostname='10.0.0.1', api_username='ro_admin', api_password='************')
checks_a  = CheckFirewall(node_a)

node_b    = FirewallProxy(hostname='10.0.0.2', api_username='ro_admin', api_password='************')
checks_b  = CheckFirewall(node_b)

snapshot_a  = checks_a.run_snapshots(['license'])
snapshot_b  = checks_b.run_snapshots(['license'])

diff_obj = SnapshotCompare(snapshot_a, snapshot_b)
license_diff = diff_obj.compare_snapshots([{
  'license': {
    'properties': ['!serial', '!authcode']
  }
}])

if not license_diff['license']['changed']['passed']:
  printer(license_diff['license']['changed']['changed_raw'])
  # ... code that handles failed check
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The sample output of the above script:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Output" default>
```

```console showLineNumbers
GlobalProtect Gateway:
   | passed: True
WildFire License:
   | passed: True
DNS Security:
   | passed: True
AutoFocus Device License:
   | passed: False
   | missing:
   |   | passed: True
   | added:
   |   | passed: True
   | changed:
   |   | passed: False
   |   | changed_raw:
   |   |   | expires:
