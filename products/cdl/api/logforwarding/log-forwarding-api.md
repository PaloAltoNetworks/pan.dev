Welcome to the Cortex Data Lake Log Forwarding APIs. To use these APIs, you must be a new Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) customer as of March 2022 and must have configured your multitenant hierarchy for a new deployment of Prisma Access.
After you have configured your tenants, these APIs can be used to add, modify, and delete syslog, HTTPS, and email log forwarding profiles.

For more in-depth information regarding these APIs, please see the
[Log Forwarding Developer Docs](/cdl/docs/log-forwarding/).

The functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the [Cortex Data Lake user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-data-lake/cortex-data-lake-getting-started/get-started-with-log-forwarding-app).

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
