# HTTPS Log Forwarding

Please consider the following when creating and managing HTTPS profiles.

## Client Authorization and Payload Format

When creating or editing an HTTPS profile, `payloadFormat` must correspond to the `clientAuth`:

| `clientAuth`          | `payloadFormat`                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ClientAuthBasic`     | `"ARRAY_JSON"` or `"STACKED_JASON"` |
| `ClientAuthSentinel`  | `"ARRAY_JSON"`                      |
| `ClientAuthSplunk`    | `"STACKED_JASON"`                   |
| `ClientAuthChronicle` | `"Array JSON"`                      |

Any other combination will throw a mapping error.

## Null Value on GET Call

When you create an HTTPS profile with the POST API, you must pass a value for `ClientAuth`. However, for security reasons, when you retrieve a profile with a GET call, `ClientAuth` will return `null`.

## (Google Chronicle Only) Stringify Service Account Token

When `clientAuth` is `ClientAuthChronicle`, you must provide a `serviceAccount` JSON object. In order to pass the JSON object, you must first convert it into a string.

For definitions of the fields mentioned, please see the [API Reference](/cdl/api/log-forwarding/).
