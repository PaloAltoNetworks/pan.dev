# `ConfigParser` class Dialect

The [`ConfigParser`][cfgprs] class is used throughout the project. It assumes and understands a specific dialect, hence it's vital to know it and understand it.

Below are the concepts of that dialect:

* all configuration elements passed to the [`ConfigParser`][cfgprs] class are bundled in a list,
* all configuration elements are case-sensitive,
* if an element is `str`, it is the name of an element,
* if an element is `dict`, the key is treated as the name of the element and the value is simply a configuration for this element,
* the `all` item is equal to all items from the valid configuration elements,
* an empty list is the same as the list containing only the `all` item,
* excluding elements are supported by prefixing an item with an exclamation mark, for example, `'!config'` will skip the `'config'` element.

  These elements are called `not-elements`. They are useful when combined with `all`.
  For example: a list of: `['all', '!tcp']` or simply `['!tcp']` would take all valid elements except for `tcp`.
  
  Having that said:

* a list containing only `not-elements` is treated as if `'all'` would have been specified explicitly,
* order does not matter,
* you can override elements implicitly specified with `all`. This means that:
  * when:
    * the following list is passed:

      ``` yaml
      [
          'all', 
          { 'content_version': {
              'version': '1234-5678'}
          }
      ]
      ```

    * `content_version` is a valid element
  * then:
    * `all` is expanded to all valid elements but
    * `content_version` is skipped during expansion (since an explicit definition for it is already available).
