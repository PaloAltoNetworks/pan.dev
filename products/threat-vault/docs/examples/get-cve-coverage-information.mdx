The API Reference information for retrieving CVE Coverage information can be found
[here](/threat-vault/api/get-cve-coverage/).

## Overview

The Threat Vault API can be used to request CVE Coverage information. Consider the following examples:

Keep a few things in mind when formatting your API query:

1. All the query strings in Get requests must be a URL-Encoded parameter string. If you use a space in the URL-Encoded request, you must include either a plus sign (+) or %20 to replace the space.
2. You can specify the content type of the request body and response by specifying the Content-Type header. Some responses generate an HTTP response in addition to a JSON object.
3. Do not embed API keys in code or application source tree files. This can inadvertently expose the API key. Instead, consider storing the API key in environmental variables or files that are excluded from your application source tree files.

## Example 1: Request information about a specific CVE ID with matching Threat Vault signatures:

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats/cve-coverage?cve_id=CVE-2021-1647'
```

A successful API call returns, within the contents section, `status="success"` along with the matching CVE results. In this example, the CVE entries for CVE-2021-1647 have matching Threat Vault (antivirus and vulnerability) signatures. Matches are indicated by the entry "cve_status": "cve_covered".

## Example 2: Request information about a specific CVE ID with in-progress Threat Vault signatures:

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats/cve-coverage?cve_id=CVE-2025-23120'
```

A successful API call returns, within the Contents section, `status="success"` along with the associated IP feed entry details. In this example, the CVE entry for CVE-2025-23120 indicates a matching CVE result. While there are no active Threat Vault signatures available, one is currently undergoing testing and is expected to be released.

```json

        "next": null,
        "previous": null
    },

    "data": [

            "response_text": "This CVE has been assigned to a researcher and is being analyzed"
        }
    ],
    "message": "Successful"
}
```

## Example 3: Request information about a specific CVE ID with matching Threat Vault signatures that are currently being monitored:

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats/cve-coverage?cve_id=CVE-2025-26633'
```

A successful API call returns, within the Contents section, `status="success"` along with the associated IP feed entry details. In this example, the CVE entries for CVE-2025-26633 have matching CVE result, however, it does not have any active Threat Vault signatures available, but it is being actively monitored:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "link": {

        "previous": null
    },
    "count": 1,

        }
    ],
    "message": "Successful"
}
```

## Example 4: Request information about a specific CVE ID without matching Threat Vault signatures:

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats/cve-coverage?cve_id=CVE-2024-38140''
```

A successful API call returns, within the Contents section, `status="success"` along with the associated IP feed entry details. In this example, the CVE entries for CVE-2024-38140 have matching CVE result, however, it does not have any active Threat Vault signatures available:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "link": {
        "next": null,
        "previous": null
    },
    "count": 1,

}
```
