The API Reference information for retrieving IPS threat signature metadata can be found [here](/threat-vault/api/threat-prevention#operation/threats).

## Overview

The Threat Vault API can be used to request IPS threat signature metadata. Consider the following examples:

Keep a few things in mind when formatting your API query:

1. All the query strings in Get requests must be a URL-Encoded parameter string. If you use a space in the URL-Encoded request, you must include either a plus sign (+) or %20 to replace the space.
2. You can specify the content type of the request body and response by specifying the Content-Type header. Some responses generate an HTTP response in addition to a JSON object.
3. Do not embed API keys in code or application source tree files. This can inadvertently expose the API key. Instead, consider storing the API key in environmental variables or files that are excluded from your application source tree files.

## Example 1: Request information about a specific threat signature ID

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats?id=30001'
```

A successful API call returns, within the contents section, `status="success"` along with the threat signature details, in this case, a vulnerability signature:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "link": {
    "next": null,
    "previous": null
  },

      }
    ]
  },

}
```

## Example 2: Request information about threat signatures that match user-defined keywords

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats?name=Code+Injection+JS'
```

A successful API call returns, within the Contents section, `status="success"` along with IPS threat signatures that contain any of the following strings: `Code` `Injection` or `JS`:

```json

    "next": null,

## Example 3: Request information about threat signatures that match a specific CVE

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats?cve=CVE-2020-2040'
```

A successful API call returns, within the Contents section, `status="success"` along with IPS threat signatures that directly match with `CVE-2020-2040`:

## Example 5: Request information about IPS threat signatures released within a version range

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats?fromReleaseVersion=8440&toReleaseVersion=8443'
```

A successful API call returns, within the Contents section, `status="success"` along with the IPS threat signatures that have been released between content release version `8440` and `8443`:

## Example 9: Request information about IPS signatures

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: API_KEY' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats?type=ips'
