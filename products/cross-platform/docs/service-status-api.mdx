There is a Palo Alto Networks cross-platform Status Page hosted at https://status.paloaltonetworks.com. There is documentation for the companion API for this Status Page, hosted at https://status.paloaltonetworks.com/api, which includes a Javascript wrapper.

The API itself is delivered via Atlassian's StatusPage offering. This API provides a collections of endpoints which all return JSON formatted payloads. The API does not provide any built-in filtering; any filtering or parsing of responses should be done client-side, with the suggestion to use a JSON parsing library within the programming language of choice.

The endpoints available are described below.
