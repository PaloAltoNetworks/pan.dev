# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in Azure, Centralized Architecture, Common NGFW Option with Autoscaling

Palo Alto Networks produces several
[validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures),
which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures
guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.

The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in Azure based on a centralized design with
common VM-Series with autoscaling(Virtual Machine Scale Sets); for a discussion of other options, please see the design guide from
[the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) are used for autoscaling to run the Next Generation Firewalls, with custom data plane oriented
metrics published by PanOS it is possible to adjust the number of firewall appliances to the current workload (data plane
utilization). Since firewalls are added or removed automatically, they cannot be managed in a classic way. To ease licensing,
management and updates a Panorama appliance is suggested. Deployment of a Panorama instance is not covered in this example,
but a [dedicated one exists](../standalone\_panorama).

## Reference Architecture Design

![simple](aa2ae33a-fb46-4a1c-9811-98ea3b132297.png)

This code implements:

- a *centralized design*, a hub-and-spoke topology with a Transit VNet containing VM-Series to inspect all inbound, outbound,
  east-west, and enterprise traffic
- the *common option*, which routes all traffic flows onto a single set of VM-Series
- *auto scaling- for the VM-Series, where a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) is used to provision VM-Series that will scale in and
  out dynamically, as workload demands fluctuate

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design

This design uses a Transit VNet. Application functions and resources are deployed across multiple VNets that are connected in a
hub-and-spoke topology. The hub of the topology, or transit VNet, is the central point of connectivity for all inbound, outbound,
east-west, and enterprise traffic. You deploy all VM-Series firewalls within the transit VNet.

### Common Option

The common firewall option leverages a single set of VM-Series firewalls. The sole set of firewalls operates as a shared resource
and may present scale limitations with all traffic flowing through a single set of firewalls due to the performance degradation
that occurs when traffic crosses virtual routers. This option is suitable for smaller scale deployments because inbound and
outbound traffic flows occur on the same set of firewalls. However, the technical integration complexity is high.

![Detailed Topology Diagram](516780a2-f66e-4677-885f-c5ba18db168c.png)

This reference architecture consists of:

- a VNET containing:
  - 4 subnets:
    - 3 of them dedicated to the firewalls: management, private and public
    - one dedicated to an Application Gateway
  - Route Tables and Network Security Groups
- 1 Virtual Machine Scale Set:
  - deployed across availability zones
  - for inbound, outbound and east-west traffic
  - with 3 network interfaces: management, public, private
  - with public IP addresses assigned to:
    - management interface
    - public interface - due to use of a public Load Balancer this public IP is used mainly for outgoing traffic
- 2 Load Balancers:
  - public - with a public IP address assigned, in front of the public interfaces of the firewalls in VMSS, for incoming traffic
  - private - in front of the private interfaces of the firewalls in VMSS, for outgoing and east-west traffic
- an Application Insights, used to store the custom PanOS metrics sent from firewalls in scale set
- an Application Gateway, serving as a reverse proxy for incoming traffic, with a sample rule setting the XFF header properly
- _(optional)_ test workloads with accompanying infrastructure:
  - 2 Spoke VNETs with Route Tables and Network Security Groups
  - 2 Spoke VMs serving as WordPress-based web servers
  - 2 Azure Bastion managed jump hosts

**NOTE!**
- In order to deploy the architecture without test workloads described above, empty the `test_infrastructure` map in
  `example.tfvars` file.

**Disclaimer!** \
Public IP addresses are assigned to management interfaces in this example in order to simplify the deployment. With a private
Panorama connectivity in place and Panorama Software Firewall License plugin you can bootstrap the firewalls without public IPs
assigned to the management interfaces. You should also enable
[Automatically push content when software device registers to Panorama](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-new-features/panorama-features/automatic-content-push-for-vm-series-and-cn-series-firewalls)
on the template stack and
[schedule content updates using Panorama](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-upgrade/upgrade-panorama/deploy-updates-to-firewalls-log-collectors-and-wildfire-appliances-using-panorama/schedule-a-content-update-using-panorama).
Alternatively content updates can be configured to be fetched via data plane interfaces with service routes.

### Auto Scaling VM-Series

Auto scaling: Public-cloud environments focus on scaling out a deployment instead of scaling up. This architectural difference
stems primarily from the capability of public-cloud environments to dynamically increase or decrease the number of resources
allocated to your environment. Using native Azure services like Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), Application Insights and
VM-Series automation features, the guide implements VM-Series that will scale in and out dynamically, as your protected workload
demands fluctuate. The VM-Series firewalls are deployed in a Virtual Machine Scale Set for inbound and outbound/east-west
firewalls in common option, and are automatically registered to Azure Load Balancers.

## Prerequisites

A list of requirements might vary depending on the platform used to deploy the infrastructure but a minimum one includes:

- _(in case of non cloud shell deployment)_ credentials and (optionally) tools required to authenticate against Azure Cloud, see
  [AzureRM provider documentation for details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure)
- [supported](#requirements) version of [`Terraform`](<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads>)
- if you have not run Palo Alto NGFW images in a subscription it might be necessary to accept the license first
  ([see this note](../../modules/vmseries#accept-azure-marketplace-terms))

A non-platform requirement would be a running Panorama instance. For full automation you might want to consider the following requirements:

- a template and a template stack with `DAY0` configuration
- a device group with security configuration (`DAY1` [iron skillet](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet) for example)
  and any security and NAT rules of your choice
- a [Panorama Software Firewall License](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/9-1/vm-series-deployment/license-the-vm-series-firewall/use-panorama-based-software-firewall-license-management) plugin to automatically manage licenses on newly created devices
- a [VM-Series](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/9-1/panorama-admin/panorama-plugins/plugins-types/install-the-vm-series-plugin-on-panorama)
  plugin to enable additional template options (custom metrics)

**Note!**

- after the deployment the firewalls remain not configured and not licensed.
- this example contains some **files** that **can contain sensitive data**. Keep in mind that **this code** is
  **only an example**. It's main purpose is to introduce the Terraform modules.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps

- checkout the code locally (if you haven't done so yet)
- copy the [`example.tfvars`](./example.tfvars) file, rename it to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust it to your needs (take a closer
  look at the `TODO` markers). If you already have a configured Panorama (with at least minimum configuration described above) you
  might want to also adjust the `bootstrap_options` for the scale set [`common`](./example.tfvars#L224).
- _(optional)_ authenticate to AzureRM, switch to the Subscription of your choice
- provide `subscription_id` either by creating an environment variable named `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with Subscription ID as value
  in your shell (recommended option) or by setting the value of `subscription_id` variable within your `tfvars` file (discouraged
  option, we don't recommend putting the Subscription ID in clear text inside the code).
- initialize the Terraform module:

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

- _(optional)_ plan you infrastructure to see what will be actually deployed:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

- deploy the infrastructure (you will have to confirm it with typing in `yes`):

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

  The deployment takes couple of minutes. Observe the output. At the end you should see a summary similar to this:

  ```console
  Apply complete! Resources: 43 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

  Outputs:

  lb_frontend_ips = {
    "private" = {
      "ha-ports" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
    "public" = {
      "palo-lb-app1-pip" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
  }
  metrics_instrumentation_keys = <sensitive>
  password = <sensitive>
  username = "panadmin"
  ```

- at this stage you have to wait couple of minutes for the firewalls to bootstrap.

### Post deploy

The most important post-deployment action is (for deployments with auto scaling and Panorama) to retrieve the Application Insights
instrumentation keys. This can be done by looking up the AI resources in the Azure portal, or directly from Terraform outputs:

```bash
terraform output metrics_instrumentation_keys
```

The retrieved keys should be put into appropriate templates in Panorama and pushed to the devices. From this moment on, custom
metrics are being sent to Application Insights and retrieved by the Virtual Machine Scale Set to trigger scale-in and scale-out
operations.

Although firewalls in a Scale Set are not meant to be managed directly, they are still configured with password authentication.
To retrieve the initial credentials run:

- for username:

  ```bash
  terraform output usernames
  ```

- for password:

  ```bash
  terraform output passwords
  ```

### Cleanup

To remove the deployed infrastructure run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

#### load_balancers

A map containing configuration for all (both private and public) Load Balancers.

This is a brief description of available properties. For a detailed one please refer to
[module documentation](../../modules/loadbalancer).

Following properties are available:

- `name`                    - (`string`, required) a name of the Load Balancer.
- `vnet_key`                - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a key pointing to a VNET definition in the `var.vnets`
                              map that stores the Subnet described by `subnet_key`.
- `zones`                   - (`list`, optional, defaults to ["1", "2", "3"]) a list of zones for Load Balancer's frontend IP
                              configurations.
- `backend_name`            - (`string`, optional, defaults to "vmseries_backend") a name of the backend pool to create.
- `health_probes`           - (`map`, optional, defaults to `null`) a map defining health probes that will be used by load
                              balancing rules, please refer to
                              [module documentation](../../modules/loadbalancer#health_probes) for more specific use
                              cases and available properties.
- `nsg_auto_rules_settings` - (`map`, optional, defaults to `null`) a map defining a location of an existing NSG rule that will
                              be populated with `Allow` rules for each load balancing rule (`in_rules`), please refer to
                              [module documentation](../../modules/loadbalancer#nsg_auto_rules_settings) for
                              available properties. 
                                
  Please note that in this example two additional properties are available:

  - `nsg_vnet_key` - (`string`, optional, mutually exclusive with `nsg_name`) a key pointing to a VNET definition in the
                     `var.vnets` map that stores the NSG described by `nsg_key`.
  - `nsg_key`      - (`string`, optional, mutually exclusive with `nsg_name`) a key pointing to an NSG definition in the
                     `var.vnets` map.

- `frontend_ips`            - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map containing frontend IP configuration with respective
                              `in_rules` and `out_rules`, please refer to
                              [module documentation](../../modules/loadbalancer#frontend_ips) for available
                              properties.

  **Note!** \
  In this example the `subnet_id` is not available directly, another property has been introduced instead:

  - `subnet_key` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a key pointing to a Subnet definition in the `var.vnets` map.

#### ngfw_metrics

A map controlling metrics-relates resources.

When set to explicit `null` (default) it will disable any metrics resources in this deployment.

When defined it will either create or source a Log Analytics Workspace and create Application Insights instances (one per each
Scale Set). All instances will be automatically connected to the workspace. The name of the Application Insights instance will
be derived from the Scale Set name and suffixed with `-ai`.

All the settings available below are common to the Log Analytics Workspace and Application Insight instances.

Following properties are available:

- `name`                      - (`string`, required) name of the (common) Log Analytics Workspace.
- `create_workspace`          - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `true`) controls whether we create or source an existing Log
                                Analytics Workspace.
- `resource_group_name`       - (`string`, optional, defaults to `var.resource_group_name`) name of the Resource Group hosting
                                the Log Analytics Workspace.
- `sku`                       - (`string`, optional, defaults to module default) the SKU of the Log Analytics Workspace.
- `metrics_retention_in_days` - (`number`, optional, defaults to module default) workspace and insights data retention in days,
                                possible values are between 30 and 730. For sourced Workspaces this applies only to the
                                Application Insights instances.


Type: 

```hcl
object({
    name                      = string
    create_workspace          = optional(bool, true)

#### bootstrap_storages

A map defining Azure Storage Accounts used to host file shares for bootstrapping NGFWs.

You can create or re-use an existing Storage Account and/or File Share. For details on all available properties please refer to
[module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap). Following is just an extract of the most important ones:

- `name`                      - (`string`, required) name of the Storage Account that will be created or sourced.

  **Note** \
  For new Storage Accounts this name will not be prefixed with `var.name_prefix`. \
  Please note the limitations on naming. This has to be a globally unique name, between 3 and 63 chars, only lower-case letters
  and numbers.

- `resource_group_name`       - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) name of the Resource Group that hosts (sourced) or
                                will host (created) a Storage Account. When skipped the code will fall back to
                                `var.resource_group_name`.
- `storage_account`           - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map controlling basic Storage Account configuration.

  The property you should pay attention to is:

  - `create` - (`bool`, optional, defaults to module default) controls if the Storage Account specified in the `name` property
               will be created or sourced.

  For detailed documentation see [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap#storage_account).

- `storage_network_security`  - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map defining network security settings for a **new**
                                storage account.

  The properties you should pay attention to are:

  - `allowed_subnet_keys` - (`list`, optional, defaults to `[]`) a list of keys pointing to Subnet definitions in the
                            `var.vnets` map. These Subnets will have dedicated access to the Storage Account. For this to work
                            they also need to have the Storage Account Service Endpoint enabled.
  - `vnet_key`            - (`string`, optional) a key pointing to a VNET definition in the `var.vnets` map that stores the
                            Subnets described in `allowed_subnet_keys`.

  For detailed documentation see [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap#storage_network_security).

- `file_shares_configuration` - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map defining common File Share setting.

  The properties you should pay attention to are:

  - `create_file_shares`            - (`bool`, optional, defaults to module default) controls if the File Shares defined in the
                                      `file_shares` property will be created or sourced.
  - `disable_package_dirs_creation` - (`bool`, optional, defaults to module default) for sourced File Shares, controls if the
                                      bootstrap package folder structure will be created.

  For detailed documentation see [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap#file_shares_configuration).

- `file_shares`               - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map that holds File Shares and bootstrap package
                                configuration. For detailed description see
                                [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap#file_shares).

#### scale_sets_universal

A map defining common settings for all created VM-Series Scale Sets. 
  
It duplicates popular properties from `scale_sets` variable, specifically `scale_sets.image` and 
`scale_sets.virtual_machine_scale_set` maps. However, if values are set in those maps, they still take precedence over the ones
set within this variable. As a result, all universal properties can be overriden on a per-VMSS basis.

Following properties are supported:

- `use_airs`          - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `false`) when set to `true`, the AI Runtime Security VM image is used 
                        instead of the one passed to the module and version for `airs-flex` offer must be provided.  
- `version`           - (`string`, optional) describes the PAN-OS image version from Azure Marketplace.
- `size`              - (`string`, optional, defaults to module default) Azure VM size (type). Consult the *VM-Series
                        Deployment Guide* as only a few selected sizes are supported.
- `bootstrap_options` - (`map`, optional, mutually exclusive with `bootstrap_package`) bootstrap options passed to PAN-OS
                        when launched for the 1st time, for details see module documentation.
- `bootstrap_package` - (`map`, optional, mutually exclusive with `bootstrap_options`) a map defining content of the bootstrap
                        package. For details and available properties refer to `scale_sets` variable.

#### scale_sets

A map defining Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets based on Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewall image.

For details and defaults for available options please refer to the [`vmss`](../../modules/vmss) module.

The basic Scale Set configuration properties are as follows:

- `name`                      - (`string`, required) name of the scale set, will be prefixed with the value of
                                `var.name_prefix`.
- `vnet_key`                  - (`string`, required) a key of a VNET defined in `var.vnets`. This is the VNET that hosts
                                subnets used to deploy network interfaces for VMs in this Scale Set.
- `authentication`            - (`map`, required) authentication setting for VMs deployed in this scale set.

    This map holds the firewall admin password. When this property is not set, the password will be autogenerated for you and
    available in the Terraform outputs.

    **Note!** \
    The `disable_password_authentication` property is by default true. When using this value you have to specify at least one
    SSH key. You can however set this property to `true`. Then you have 2 options, either:

    - do not specify anything else, a random password will be generated for you.
    - specify at least one of `password` or `ssh_keys` properties.

    For all properties and their default values refer to [module's documentation](../../modules/vmss#authentication).

- `image`                     - (`map`, optional) properties defining a base image used to spawn VMs in this Scale Set. The
                                `image` property is required (if no common properties were set within `scale_sets_universal` 
                                variable) but there are only 2 properties (mutually exclusive) that have to be set up, either:

    - `version`   - (`string`, optional) describes the PAN-OS image version from Azure Marketplace.
    - `custom_id` - (`string`, optional) absolute ID of your own custom PAN-OS image.

    For details on all properties refer to [module's documentation](../../modules/vmss#image).

- `virtual_machine_scale_set` - (`map`, optional, defaults to module default) a map that groups most common Scale Set
                                configuration options:

    - `size`              - (`string`, optional, defaults to module default) Azure VM size (type). Consult the *VM-Series
                            Deployment Guide* as only a few selected sizes are supported.
    - `zones`             - (`list`, optional, defaults to module default) a list of Availability Zones in which VMs from
                            this Scale Set will be created.
    - `disk_type`         - (`string`, optional, defaults to module default) type of Managed Disk which should be created,
                            possible values are `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` or `Premium_LRS` (works only for selected
                            `vm_size` values).
    - `bootstrap_options` - (`map`, optional, mutually exclusive with `bootstrap_package`) bootstrap options passed to PAN-OS
                            when launched for the 1st time, for details see module documentation.
    - `bootstrap_package` - (`map`, optional, mutually exclusive with `bootstrap_options`) a map defining content of the
                            bootstrap package.

      **Note!** \
      At least one of `static_files`, `bootstrap_xml_template` or `bootstrap_package_path` is required. You can use a
      combination of all 3. The `bootstrap_package_path` is the less important. For details on this mechanism and for details
      on the other properties see the [`bootstrap` module documentation](../../modules/bootstrap).

      Following properties are available:

      - `bootstrap_storage_key`  - (`string`, required) a key of a bootstrap storage defined in `var.bootstrap_storages` that
                                  will host bootstrap packages. Each package will be hosted on a separate File Share. The File
                                  Shares will be created automatically, one for each firewall.
      - `static_files`           - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map containing files that will be copied to a File
                                  Share, see [`file_shares.bootstrap_files`](../../modules/bootstrap#file_shares)
                                  property documentation for details.
      - `bootstrap_package_path` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a path to a folder containing a full bootstrap
                                  package.
      - `bootstrap_xml_template` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a path to a `bootstrap.xml` template. If this
                                   example is using full bootstrap method, the sample templates are in
                                   [`templates`](./templates) folder.

        The templates are used to provide `day0` like configuration which consists of:

        - network interfaces configuration.
        - one or more (depending on the architecture) Virtual Routers configurations. This config contains static routes
          required for the Load Balancer (and Application Gateway, if defined) health checks to work and routes that allow
          Inbound and OBEW traffic.
        - *any-any* security rule.
        - an outbound NAT rule that will allow the Outbound traffic to flow to the Internet.

        **Note!** \
        Day0 configuration is **not meant** to be **secure**. It's here merely to help with the basic firewall setup. When
        `bootstrap_xml_template` is set, one of the following properties might be required.

      - `private_snet_key`       - (`string`, required only when `bootstrap_xml_template` is set, defaults to `null`) a key
                                  pointing to a private Subnet definition in `var.vnets` (the `vnet_key` property is used to
                                  identify a VNET). The Subnet definition is used to calculate static routes for a private
                                  Load Balancer health checks and for Inbound traffic.
      - `public_snet_key`        - (`string`, required only when `bootstrap_xml_template` is set, defaults to `null`) a key
                                  pointing to a public Subnet definition in `var.vnets` (the `vnet_key` property is used to
                                  identify a VNET). The Subnet definition is used to calculate static routes for a public
                                  Load Balancer health checks and for Outbound traffic.
      - `ai_update_interval`     - (`number`, optional, defaults to `5`) Application Insights update interval, used only when
                                  `ngfw_metrics` module is defined and used in this example. The Application Insights
                                  Instrumentation Key will be populated automatically.
      - `intranet_cidr`          - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a CIDR of the Intranet - combined CIDR of all
                                  private networks. When set it will override the private Subnet CIDR for inbound traffic
                                  static routes.

    For details on all properties refer to [module's documentation](../../modules/vmss#virtual_machine_scale_set).

- `autoscaling_configuration` - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map that groups common autoscaling configuration, but not
                                the scaling profiles (metrics, thresholds, etc.). Most common properties are:

    - `default_count`   - (`number`, optional, defaults to module default) minimum number of instances that should be present
                          in the scale set when the autoscaling engine cannot read the metrics or is otherwise unable to
                          compare the metrics to the thresholds.

    For details on all properties refer to [module's documentation](../../modules/vmss#autoscaling_configuration).

- `interfaces`                - (`list`, required) configuration of all network interfaces, order does matter - the
                                1<sup>st</sup> interface should be the management one. Following properties are available:

  - `name`                    - (`string`, required) name of the network interface (will be prefixed with `var.name_prefix`).
  - `subnet_key`              - (`string`, required) a key of a subnet to which the interface will be assigned as defined in
                                `var.vnets`.
  - `ip_configurations`       - (`map`, required) A map that contains the IP configurations for the interface.
      - `name`                  - (`string`, optional, defaults to `primary`) the name of the interface IP configuration.
      - `primary`               - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `true`) sets the current IP configuration as the primary one.
      - `create_public_ip`      - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `false`) if `true`, create a public IP for the interface.
  - `load_balancer_key`       - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) key of a Load Balancer defined in the
                                `var.loadbalancers` variable, network interface that has this property defined will be added to
                                the Load Balancer's backend pool.
  - `application_gateway_key` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) key of an Application Gateway defined in the
                                `var.appgws`, network interface that has this property defined will be added to the Application
                                Gateways's backend pool.
    
  For details on all properties refer to [module's documentation](../../modules/vmss#interfaces).

- `autoscaling_profiles`      - (`list`, optional, defaults to `[]`) a list of autoscaling profiles, for details on available
                                properties please refer to
                                [module's documentation](../../modules/vmss#autoscaling_profiles).

#### test_infrastructure

A map defining test infrastructure including test VMs and Azure Bastion hosts.

For details and defaults for available options please refer to the
[`test_infrastructure`](../../modules/test_infrastructure) module.

Following properties are supported:

- `create_resource_group`  - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `true`) when set to `true`, a new Resource Group is created. When
                             set to `false`, an existing Resource Group is sourced.
- `resource_group_name`    - (`string`, optional) name of the Resource Group to be created or sourced.
- `vnets`                  - (`map`, required) a map defining VNETs and peerings for the test environment. The most basic
                             properties are as follows:

  - `create_virtual_network`  - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `true`) when set to `true` will create a VNET,
                                `false` will source an existing VNET.
  - `name`                    - (`string`, required) a name of a VNET. In case `create_virtual_network = `false` this should be
                                a full resource name, including prefixes.
  - `address_space`           - (`list(string)`, required when `create_virtual_network = `false`) a list of CIDRs for a newly
                                created VNET.
  - `network_security_groups` - (`map`, optional) map of Network Security Groups to create, for details see
                                [VNET module documentation](../../modules/vnet#network_security_groups).
  - `route_tables`            - (`map`, optional) map of Route Tables to create, for details see
                                [VNET module documentation](../../modules/vnet#route_tables).
  - `subnets`                 - (`map`, optional) map of Subnets to create or source, for details see
                                [VNET module documentation](../../modules/vnet#subnets).
  - `local_peer_config`       - (`map`, optional) a map that contains local peer configuration parameters. This value allows to 
                                set `allow_virtual_network_access`, `allow_forwarded_traffic`, `allow_gateway_transit` and 
                                `use_remote_gateways` parameters on the local VNet peering. 
  - `remote_peer_config`      - (`map`, optional) a map that contains remote peer configuration parameters. This value allows to
                                set `allow_virtual_network_access`, `allow_forwarded_traffic`, `allow_gateway_transit` and 
                                `use_remote_gateways` parameters on the remote VNet peering.  

  For all properties and their default values see [module's documentation](../../modules/test_infrastructure#vnets).

- `load_balancers`         - (`map`, optional) a map containing configuration for all (both private and public) Load Balancers.
                             The most basic properties are as follows:

  - `name`                    - (`string`, required) a name of the Load Balancer.
  - `vnet_key`                - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a key pointing to a VNET definition in the `var.vnets`
                                map that stores the Subnet described by `subnet_key`.
  - `zones`                   - (`list`, optional, defaults to ["1", "2", "3"]) a list of zones for Load Balancer's frontend IP
                                configurations.
  - `backend_name`            - (`string`, optional) a name of the backend pool to create.
  - `health_probes`           - (`map`, optional, defaults to `null`) a map defining health probes that will be used by load
                                balancing rules, please refer to
                                [loadbalancer module documentation](../../modules/loadbalancer#health_probes) for
                                more specific use cases and available properties.
  - `nsg_auto_rules_settings` - (`map`, optional, defaults to `null`) a map defining a location of an existing NSG rule that
                                will be populated with `Allow` rules for each load balancing rule (`in_rules`), please refer to
                                [loadbalancer module documentation](../../modules/loadbalancer#nsg_auto_rules_settings)
                                for available properties.

  Please note that in this example two additional properties are available:

    - `nsg_vnet_key` - (`string`, optional, mutually exclusive with `nsg_name`) a key pointing to a VNET definition in the
                       `var.vnets` map that stores the NSG described by `nsg_key`.
    - `nsg_key`      - (`string`, optional, mutually exclusive with `nsg_name`) a key pointing to an NSG definition in the
                       `var.vnets` map.

  - `frontend_ips`            - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map containing frontend IP configuration with respective
                                `in_rules` and `out_rules`, please refer to
                                [loadbalancer module documentation](../../modules/loadbalancer#frontend_ips) for
                                available properties.

    **Note!** \
    In this example the `subnet_id` is not available directly, another property has been introduced instead:

    - `subnet_key` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a key pointing to a Subnet definition in the `var.vnets` map.

  For all properties and their default values see
  [module's documentation](../../modules/test_infrastructure#load_balancers).

- `authentication`         - (`map`, optional, defaults to example defaults) authentication settings for the deployed VMs.
- `spoke_vms`              - (`map`, required) a map defining test VMs. The most basic properties are as follows:

  - `name`              - (`string`, required) a name of the VM.
  - `vnet_key`          - (`string`, required) a key describing a VNET defined in `vnets` property.
  - `subnet_key`        - (`string`, required) a key describing a Subnet found in a VNET definition.
  - `load_balancer_key` - (`string`, optional) a key describing a Load Balancer defined in `load_balancers` property.

  For all properties and their default values see
  [module's documentation](../../modules/test_infrastructure#test_vms).

- `bastions`               - (`map`, required) a map containing Azure Bastion definitions. The most basic properties are as
                             follows:

  - `name`       - (`string`, required) an Azure Bastion name.
  - `vnet_key`   - (`string`, required) a key describing a VNET defined in `vnets` property. This VNET should already have an
                   existing subnet called `AzureBastionSubnet` (the name is hardcoded by Microsoft).
  - `subnet_key` - (`string`, required) a key pointing to a Subnet dedicated to a Bastion deployment.

  For all properties and their default values see
  [module's documentation](../../modules/test_infrastructure#bastions).
