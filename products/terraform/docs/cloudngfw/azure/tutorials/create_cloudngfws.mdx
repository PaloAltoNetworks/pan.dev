# Create Cloud NGFWs

:::important
This is a multi-section tutorial, with dependencies between each section. Please perform each section in order, per the links on the left-hand sidebar.
:::

## Objective

In this next part of the tutorial, the objective is to use Terraform to create Cloud NGFW resources, the enforcement points between the two lab DMZ subnets you have deployed. The committed rulestack from the previous section will then be attached to the Cloud NGFW resources.

## Assumptions and Lab Guidance

Please ensure you have read and understood the [assumptions](/terraform/docs/cloudngfw/aws/tutorials/intro/#assumptions) and [lab guideance](terraform/docs/cloudngfw/aws/tutorials/intro/#important---work-in-a-lab-environment-first) at the start of this multi-section tutorial.

## Select and configure Terraform Providers

First, create a `providers.tf` file, in a directory called `02_cloudngfw_resources`. This file defines any Terraform providers you will use, and configures them appropriately. Here we define the AWS and Cloud NGFW providers.

```hcl title="02_cloudngfw_resources/providers.tf"
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudngfwaws = {
      source  = "paloaltonetworks/cloudngfwaws"
      version = "1.0.8"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.5"
    }
  }
}

# Configure AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region     = local.aws_region
  access_key = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key
}

# Configure Cloud NGFW Provider
provider "cloudngfwaws" {
  host    = "api.${local.aws_region}.aws.cloudngfw.paloaltonetworks.com"
  region  = local.aws_region
  lfa_arn = local.cloudngfw_role_arn
  lra_arn = local.cloudngfw_role_arn
}
```

## Define input variables

Create a `variables.tf` file in the `02_cloudngfw_resources` directory. Some values are retrieved from the outputs of the first section of this tutorial, where you created your AWS infrastructure.

```hcl title="02_cloudngfw_resources/variables.tf"
# AWS Provider Variables
variable "aws_access_key" {
  type = string
}

variable "aws_secret_key" {
  type = string
}

# Build path to AWS Infrastructure's Terraform state
data "terraform_remote_state" "aws_infra" {
  backend = "local"
  config = {
    path = "../00_aws_infra/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

# Build path to Cloud NGFW Rulestack's Terraform state
data "terraform_remote_state" "cloudngfw_rulestack" {
  backend = "local"
  config = {
    path = "../01_cloudngfw_rulestacks_rules/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

# Variables - values retrieved from previous Terraform deployment, using the deployment's state as declared above
locals {
  projectname            = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.projectname
  aws_account_id         = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.aws_account_id
  aws_region             = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.aws_region
  aws_vpc_id             = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.vpc_id
  cloudngfw_role_arn     = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.cloudngfw_role_arn
  cloudngfw_subnet_id    = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.cloudngfw_subnet_id
  dmz1_subnet_cidr_block = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.dmz1_subnet_cidr_block
  dmz2_subnet_cidr_block = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.dmz2_subnet_cidr_block
  dmz1_routetable_id     = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.dmz1_routetable_id
  dmz2_routetable_id     = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.dmz2_routetable_id
  rulestack_name         = data.terraform_remote_state.cloudngfw_rulestack.outputs.rulestack_name
  cloudwatch_log_group   = data.terraform_remote_state.aws_infra.outputs.cloudwatch_log_group
}
```

## Define input variable values

Next, create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `02_cloudngfw_resources` directory. This file defines values for all the variables defined in the `variables.tf` file.

Note that you are authenticating to AWS with credentials stored in this `terraform.tfvars` file. This is just one of [many options for the AWS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration), and care should be taken to ensure that this method is appropriate for your environment. Per the lab guidance above, ideally this tutorial would be performed in a non-production AWS account which contains no production assets or data. An alternative to storing the credentials in this file would be to [provide them via environment variables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration).

```hcl title="02_cloudngfw_resources/terraform.tfvars"
# AWS Provider Variables
aws_access_key          = "ABC123"
aws_secret_key          = "abc123abc123"
```

## Define Cloud NGFW resources

The next file, `main.tf`, defines the Cloud NGFW resources for this VPC. Rulestack assignment and logging destination are also defined:

```hcl title="02_cloudngfw_resources/main.tf"
# Create Cloud NGFW resources (managed next-generation firewall instances)
resource "cloudngfwaws_ngfw" "the_cloud_ngfw" {
  name        = "${local.projectname}-cloudngfw-instance"
  vpc_id      = local.aws_vpc_id
  account_id  = local.aws_account_id
  description = "First NGFW resource for Project ${local.projectname}"

  endpoint_mode = "ServiceManaged"
  subnet_mapping {
    subnet_id = local.cloudngfw_subnet_id
  }

  rulestack = local.rulestack_name

  tags = {
    project = "${local.projectname}"
  }
}

resource "cloudngfwaws_ngfw_log_profile" "the_logging" {
  ngfw       = cloudngfwaws_ngfw.the_cloud_ngfw.name
  account_id = cloudngfwaws_ngfw.the_cloud_ngfw.account_id

  log_destination {
    destination_type = "CloudWatchLogs"
    destination      = "PaloAltoCloudNGFW"
    log_type         = "TRAFFIC"
  }
}
```

## Define required outputs

The final file for this section, `outputs.tf`, defines which values Terraform should present and make available at the end of the `apply` phase. With this output you will be able to see the status of the Cloud NGFW resources.

```hcl title="02_cloudngfw_resources/outputs.tf"
# Cloud NGFW Overall Status
output "cloudngfw_status" {
  value = cloudngfwaws_ngfw.the_cloud_ngfw.status[0]
}
```

## Terraform init

With all the files above in place, ensure you are in the `02_cloudngfw_resources` directory, then execute `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory and download the required providers. Your output should look similar to this:

```hcl
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- terraform.io/builtin/terraform is built in to Terraform
- Finding paloaltonetworks/cloudngfwaws versions matching "1.0.8"...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "~> 4.5"...
- Installing paloaltonetworks/cloudngfwaws v1.0.8...
- Installed paloaltonetworks/cloudngfwaws v1.0.8 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID D1B17746D294B5C8)
- Installing hashicorp/aws v4.52.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v4.52.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
```

## Terraform plan

Next, run `terraform plan` to view the upcoming changes Terraform would make next in order to perform the commit operation. The output should look similar to this, truncated for brevity:

```hcl
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # cloudngfwaws_ngfw.the_cloud_ngfw will be created
  + resource "cloudngfwaws_ngfw" "the_cloud_ngfw" {
      + account_id                       = "296803593844"
      + app_id_version                   = (known after apply)
      + automatic_upgrade_app_id_version = true
      + description                      = "First NGFW resource for Project Lab"
      + endpoint_mode                    = "ServiceManaged"
      + endpoint_service_name            = (known after apply)
.
.
.
.
.
      + subnet_mapping {
          + subnet_id = "subnet-0755fad05e6e25011"
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

## Terraform apply

If you are happy with the plan, as described in the output from the previous step, instruct Terraform to create the AWS infrastructure with `terraform apply --auto-approve`. The output will look like this:

```hcl
cloudngfwaws_ngfw.the_cloud_ngfw: Creating...
cloudngfwaws_ngfw.the_cloud_ngfw: Creation complete after 8s [id=296803593844:Lab-cloudngfw-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

cloudngfw_overall_status = {
  "attachment" = tolist([])
  "failure_reason" = ""
  "firewall_status" = "CREATING"
  "rulestack_status" = ""
}
```

Note that the `firewall_status` is listed as "CREATING". At this stage, Cloud NGFW resources are being created for your AWS environment, and this will take 10-15 minutes to complete. You can get an update on the creation status with `terraform refresh`. At completion, the output from `terraform refresh` should look like this:

```hcl
Outputs:

cloudngfw_status = {
  "attachment" = tolist([
    {
      "endpoint_id" = "vpce-06aedff8576af4fc1"
      "rejected_reason" = ""
      "status" = "ACCEPTED"
      "subnet_id" = "subnet-0755fad05e6e25011"
    },
  ])
  "failure_reason" = ""
  "firewall_status" = "CREATE_COMPLETE"
  "rulestack_status" = "Success"
}
```

Note that `firewall_status` above is now showing "CREATE_COMPLETE", `rulestack_status` is "Success", and for the attachment of the VPC endpoint the status is "ACCEPTED".

:::caution
Wait for the positive `firewall_status`, `rulestack_status` and `attachment: status` results listed above, before proceeding to the next steps.
