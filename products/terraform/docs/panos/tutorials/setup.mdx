# Setting up

In this tutorial, you will get ready to execute Terraform plans for PAN-OS by preparing your host machine.

## Assumptions

This tutorial/guide assumes:

- you have access to a Terraform compatible host machine, with administrative credentials
- the host machine has working connectivity and access to the Internet to download content
- the host machine has working connectivity and access to either a PAN-OS next-generation firewall or Panorama

## Install Terraform

1. Download Terraform. The exact steps will differ based on your operating system and environment. Terraform downloads are listed [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads), and within the [Get Started guides](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials) provided by Hashicorp for various cloud and environments, you will find [instructions for installing Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/docker-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform).
2. Test Terraform installed correctly. Execute this command:

```
terraform -version
```

3. You should see an output like this (exact version numbers will differ, and you may receive a warning if you are not on the latest version):

```
Terraform v1.1.9

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 1.3.3. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
```

## PAN-OS Provider declaration and configuration

Within the Terraform code in your working directory, you should declare:
- the PAN-OS provider, with version constraints
- the hostname/IP address of the PAN-OS device you are going to be using
- the administrative credentials for the PAN-OS device you are going to be using

The tutorials in this section all include code to cover these requirements within their step-by-step instructions, so you can move onto one of the tutorials now.

For informational purposes, example declarations will be shown below. First is the provider declaration, which would typically live in a `providers.tf` file:

```hcl
# Declare PAN-OS Terraform provider, with a version constraint

terraform {
  required_providers {
    panos = {
      source  = "paloaltonetworks/panos"
      version = "~> 1.11.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the PAN-OS Terraform provider with hostname and administrative credential variables

provider "panos" {
  hostname = var.panos_hostname
  username = var.panos_username
  password = var.panos_password
}
```

Second is the declaration of the variables used to configure the provider, which would typically live in a `variables.tf` file, and would *not* normally include hard-coded vales:

```hcl
# Define the values for the variables

variable "panos_hostname" {
  type    = string
  default = "192.168.1.1"
}

variable "panos_username" {
  type    = string
  default = "admin"
}

variable "panos_password" {
  type    = string
  default = "admin"
}
```
