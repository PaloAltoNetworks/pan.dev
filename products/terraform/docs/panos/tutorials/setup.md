## Install Terraform

1. Download Terraform. The exact steps will differ based on your operating system and environment. Terraform downloads are listed [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads), and within the [Get Started guides](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials) provided by Hashicorp for various cloud and environments, you will find [instructions for installing Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/docker-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform).
2. Test Terraform installed correctly. Execute this command:
```
terraform -version
```
3. You should see an output like this (exact version numbers will differ, and you may receive a warning if you are not on the latest version):
```
Terraform v1.1.9

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 1.3.3. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
