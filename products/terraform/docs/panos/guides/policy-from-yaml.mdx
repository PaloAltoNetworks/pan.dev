# Configure Policy from YAML

The Terraform provider for PAN-OS provides a mechanism for you to adopt a policy-as-code approach, and ideally the source data for your policy will not be stored with the workflow definition; that is, the data that defines the rules in the policy (the source, the destination, the action, etc) will not be hard-coded into the Terraform code itself. One common approach is to store the policy definition in a source of structured data, such as YAML, which is maintained under version control. Then, similar to a GitOps approach, a workflow or pipeline would execute whenever the policy data is modified, and update the live policy in PAN-OS reflect the changes in the data source.

In this guide, you will create Terraform code which will configure your security polices (firewall rules) from a YAML file as a source of structured data for your policy definition.

<Assumptions />

<LabGuidance />

## Get Terraform ready for configuration

First, ensure that you have declared the PAN-OS provider for use in your Terraform configuration, and provided credentials and a hostname to target. This is discussed in the [Setting Up](../../tutorials/setup/#pan-os-provider-declaration-and-configuration) tutorial and in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PaloAltoNetworks/panos/latest/docs#example-provider-usage).

Note that the hostname used with the PAN-OS Terraform provider should be that of your Panorama.

## YAML source data

For this guide, you will use a source of structured data in YAML format. For the purposes of this guide, the file is called `policy.yml` and is stored in the local directory with the Terraform code.

```yaml title="policy.yml"
security_policies:
  - name: "Allow DNS"
    tags:
      - infra
    source_zones:
      - app
    source_addresses:
      - 10.0.0.0/8
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    destination_zones:
      - dmz
    destination_addresses:
      - 8.8.8.8
    applications:
      - dns
    action: "allow"

  - name: "Allow Internet access for Users"
    tags:
      - internet
    source_zones:
      - users
    source_addresses:
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    destination_zones:
      - internet
    applications:
      - ssl
      - web-browsing
    action: "allow"

  - name: "Access to Mgmt Network - Allow Infra Team"
    tags:
      - infra
    source_zones:
      - users
    source_users:
      - "domain/infra-team"
    source_addresses:
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    destination_zones:
      - mgmt
    applications:
      - any
    action: "allow"

  - name: "Access to Mgmt Network - Cleanup"
    tags:
      - infra
    source_zones:
      - users
    source_addresses:
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    destination_zones:
      - mgmt
    applications:
      - any
    action: "deny"
```

## Create Device Group and Security Profiles

The first steps define a Device Group within which you will create the rules, and any Security Profiles which the policies will refer to:

```hcl
# Create a Device Group
resource "panos_panorama_device_group" "dg1" {
  name        = "policy-as-code"
  description = "example device group for policy as code demo"
}

# Create an Anti-Virus Security Profile
resource "panos_antivirus_security_profile" "av1" {
  name         = "AV Protection"
  device_group = panos_panorama_device_group.dg1.name
  description  = "Example AV profile"

  decoder { name = "smtp" }
  decoder { name = "smb" }
  decoder { name = "pop3" }
  decoder { name = "imap" }
  decoder {
    name   = "http"
    action = "reset-both"
  }
  decoder { name = "http2" }
  decoder {
    name   = "ftp"
    action = "reset-both"
  }
}
```

## Create rules from YAML source data

The final part of the Terraform code creates the security policy rules within the Device Group.

Here, a `for_each` loop is used to iterate over each entry within the `security_policies` list within the YAML file. Each entry is a rule, and the rule values are used to create the PAN-OS rule attributes. A `format` statement uses the implicit key of the YAML data for indexing the rules, to ensure that the rules are created in PAN-OS in the same order as they appear in the YAML source file.

```hcl
resource "panos_panorama_security_rule_group" "this" {

  device_group = panos_panorama_device_group.dg1.name

  dynamic "rule" {
    for_each = { for key, policy in yamldecode(file("./policy.yml")).security_policies : format("%.4d", key) => policy }
    content {
      name                  = rule.value.name
      source_zones          = lookup(rule.value, "source_zones", ["any"])
      source_addresses      = lookup(rule.value, "source_addresses", ["any"])
      source_users          = lookup(rule.value, "source_users", ["any"])
      destination_zones     = lookup(rule.value, "destination_zones", ["any"])
      destination_addresses = lookup(rule.value, "destination_addresses", ["any"])
      applications          = lookup(rule.value, "applications", ["any"])
      services              = lookup(rule.value, "services", ["application-default"])
      categories            = lookup(rule.value, "categories", ["any"])
      virus                 = panos_antivirus_security_profile.av1.name
      action                = lookup(rule.value, "action", "allow")
    }
  }
}
```

## Confirm source data is translated into PAN-OS

When executing `terraform plan`, the results should show that the 4 rules defined in the `policy.yml` file have been interpreted by Terraform, and converted into PAN-OS rules, ready to be added to Panorama's candidate configuration with `terraform apply`:

```hcl
  # panos_panorama_security_rule_group.this will be created
  + resource "panos_panorama_security_rule_group" "this" {
      + device_group = "policy-as-code"
      + id           = (known after apply)
      + rulebase     = "pre-rulebase"
      + vsys         = "vsys1"

      + rule {

## Apply the rules to PAN-OS policy

The final step is to use `terraform apply` to make your rule changes in the PAN-OS candidate configuration, ready for commit and push to your NGFWs.
