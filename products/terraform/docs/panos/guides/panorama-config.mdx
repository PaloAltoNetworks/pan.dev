# Configure with Panorama

In this guide, you will make configuration changes for a NGFW on Panorama. You will first create a Device Group, Template and Template Stack, and the populate them with configuration for the target NGFW. This will include networking configuration for interfaces and routing, then rules and objects for security policies.

<Assumptions />

<LabGuidance />

## Get Terraform ready for configuration

First, ensure that you have declared the PAN-OS provider for use in your Terraform configuration, and provided credentials and a hostname to target. This is discussed in the [Setting Up](../../tutorials/setup/#pan-os-provider-declaration-and-configuration) tutorial and in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PaloAltoNetworks/panos/latest/docs#example-provider-usage).

Note that the hostname used with the PAN-OS Terraform provider should be that of your Panorama.

## Device Group and Template Stack Creation

When working with Panorama, Device Groups and Template Stacks are used to define configuration which can be shared across multiple NGFWs. Template Stacks contain one or more Templates to achieve hierarchy of configuration items.

Device Groups, Templates and Template Stacks can be created using the PAN-OS Terraform provider. They are declared like other resources:

```hcl
# Create Device Group
resource "panos_device_group" "dg1" {
  name        = "Lab-DG"
  description = "Device Group for Lab Purposes"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

#Create Template and Stack
resource "panos_panorama_template" "tpl1" {
  name        = "Lab-TPL"
  description = "Template for Lab Purposes"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "panos_panorama_template_stack" "tplstack1" {
  name        = "Lab-TPL-Stack"
  description = "Template Stack for Lab Purposes"
  templates   = [panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name]

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Networking Configuration

When configured with Panorama, NGFW networking configuration is defined within Templates. With a Template created in the previous step, networking configuration such as interfaces, virtual routers and routes can now be defined. Note the `panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name` reference to the Template created previously:

```hcl
# Configure Interfaces
resource "panos_panorama_ethernet_interface" "e1" {
  vsys        = "vsys1"
  name        = "ethernet1/1"
  mode        = "layer3"
  static_ips  = ["1.2.3.5/24"]
  enable_dhcp = false
  // highlight-next-line
  template    = panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "panos_panorama_ethernet_interface" "e2" {
  vsys        = "vsys1"
  name        = "ethernet1/2"
  mode        = "layer3"
  static_ips  = ["172.16.18.1/24"]
  enable_dhcp = false
  // highlight-next-line
  template    = panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

# Create a Virtual Router
resource "panos_virtual_router" "vr1" {
  name = "new-vrouter"
  interfaces = [
    panos_panorama_ethernet_interface.e1.name,
    panos_panorama_ethernet_interface.e2.name,
  ]
  // highlight-next-line
  template = panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

# Create Default Route
resource "panos_panorama_static_route_ipv4" "defaultroute" {
  name           = "DefaultRoute"
  virtual_router = panos_virtual_router.vr1.name
  destination    = "0.0.0.0/0"
  interface      = panos_panorama_ethernet_interface.e1.name
  next_hop       = "1.2.3.1"
  // highlight-next-line
  template       = panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Creating Security Zones

Also created within the context of Templates when using Panorama are security zones, which will be used later within security policy rules. Again note the `panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name` reference to the Template created previously, as well as the assignment of previously interfaces to the zones:

```hcl
# Configure Security Zones
resource "panos_zone" "internet" {
  name = "internet"
  mode = "layer3"
  interfaces = [
    // highlight-next-line
    panos_panorama_ethernet_interface.e1.name,
  ]
  enable_user_id = false
  // highlight-next-line
  template       = panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "panos_zone" "dmz" {
  name = "dmz"
  mode = "layer3"
  interfaces = [
    // highlight-next-line
    panos_panorama_ethernet_interface.e2.name,
  ]
  enable_user_id = false
  // highlight-next-line
  template       = panos_panorama_template.tpl1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Address Objects and Groups

Address objects and address groups are referred to within security policy rules (firewall rules). The rules and all the referenced objects are defined either as `shared` or within Device Groups, when using Panorama. The following address objects and group configuration uses the Device Group created in earlier steps, and hence there are references to `panos_device_group.dg1.name` below:

```hcl
#Create Address Objects and Group
resource "panos_address_object" "addobj1" {
  name         = "AddressObject-1"
  value        = "192.168.1.1/32"
  // highlight-next-line
  device_group = panos_device_group.dg1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "panos_address_object" "addobj2" {
  name         = "AddressObject-2"
  value        = "192.168.1.2/32"
  // highlight-next-line
  device_group = panos_device_group.dg1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "panos_panorama_address_group" "addgrp1" {
  name = "AddressGroup-1"
  static_addresses = [
    panos_address_object.addobj1.name,
    panos_address_object.addobj2.name,
  ]
  // highlight-next-line
  device_group = panos_device_group.dg1.name

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Configuring Security Rules

Security rules are also configured within either a `shared` context or within the context of specific Device Groups. Again the configuration references the Device Group created in earlier steps, as well as the address group created in the previous step:

```hcl
# Create Security Policy Rules
resource "panos_security_policy" "rules" {
  rule {
    name                  = "Rule-1"
    audit_comment         = "Initial config"
    source_zones          = [panos_zone.dmz.name]
    // highlight-next-line
    source_addresses      = [panos_panorama_address_group.addgrp1.name]
    source_users          = ["any"]
    destination_zones     = [panos_zone.internet.name]
    destination_addresses = ["any"]
    applications          = ["ssh"]
    services              = ["application-default"]
    categories            = ["any"]
    action                = "allow"
  }
  rule {
    name                  = "Rule-2"
    audit_comment         = "Initial config"
    source_zones          = [panos_zone.dmz.name]
    // highlight-next-line
    source_addresses      = [panos_panorama_address_group.addgrp1.name]
    source_users          = ["any"]
    destination_zones     = [panos_zone.internet.name]
    destination_addresses = ["any"]
    applications          = ["any"]
    services              = ["any"]
    categories            = ["any"]
    action                = "deny"
  }
  // highlight-next-line
  device_group = panos_device_group.dg1.name
  rulebase     = "post-rulebase"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Closing Notes
- Almost all values were defined within the code; names of configuration items, IP addresses, and more. This is very suitable for a learning tutorial, but this approach does not scale well in production, and using variables instead is something to consider as you operationalize Terraform within your organization.
