# Working with Multiple PAN-OS Versions

In general, the provider has support for PAN-OS 6.1 onwards.  Data
sources or resources that have minimum PAN-OS version requirements will
specify their version requirements in their [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PaloAltoNetworks/panos/latest/docs).

Some resources may contain variables that are only applicable for newer
versions of PAN-OS.  If you need to work with multiple versions of PAN-OS
where some versions have a new parameter and some don't, then make sure to use
[conditionals](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions/conditionals.html)
along with the [`panos_system_info`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PaloAltoNetworks/panos/latest/docs/data-sources/system_info) data source to only set these variables when the version of PAN-OS is appropriate.

One such resource is `panos_ethernet_interface` and the `ipv4_mss_adjust`
parameter.  Doing the following is one way to correctly configure this
parameter only when it's applicable:

```hcl
data "panos_system_info" "config" {}

data "panos_ethernet_interface" "eth1" {
    name = "ethernet1/1"
    vsys = "vsys1"
    mode = "layer3"
    adjust_tcp_mss = true
    // highlight-next-line
    ipv4_mss_adjust = "${data.panos_system_info.config.version_major >= 8 ? 42 : 0}"
    # ...
}
```
