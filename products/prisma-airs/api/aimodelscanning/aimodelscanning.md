The AI Model Scanning helps you detect threats inside your third-party AI models.
Use the AI Model Scanning APIs to scan your AI models for vulnerabilities.

Secure your AI ecosystem against risks, like model tampering, malicious scripts, and deserialization attacks.

## Prerequisites

- **API access token**

The AI Red Teaming APIs need an access token to authenticate all the endpoints requests. These APIs use a common authentication mechanism and base URL for API requests.
Follow the instructions on this [page](https://pan.dev/sase/api/auth/post-auth-v-1-oauth-2-access-token/) to generate an access token.
