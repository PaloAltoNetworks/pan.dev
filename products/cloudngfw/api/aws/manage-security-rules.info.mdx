All traffic passing through the firewall is matched against a session and each session is matched against a rule.

# Manage Security Rules



Security rules determine whether to block or allow a session based on traffic attributes such as the source and destination IP address, source and destination FQDNs, or the application.  

All traffic passing through the firewall is matched against a session and each session is matched against a rule. When a session match occurs, the NGFW applies the matching rule to bidirectional traffic in that session (client to server and server to client). For traffic that doesn’t match any defined rules, the default rules apply.  

For more information, see [Create security roles on Cloud NGFW for AWS](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-ngfw/aws/cloud-ngfw-on-aws/rules-and-rulestacks/create-a-rule).
