An FQDN object provides further ease of use because DNS provides the FQDN resolution to the IP addresses instead of you needing to know the IP addresses and manually updating them every time the FQDN resolves to a new IP address.

These are the following formats for FQDN.  

- Host names are composed of a sequence of labels concatenated with dots
- Each label must be from 1 to 63 characters long
- The entire host name, including the delimiting dots, has a maximum of 253 ASCII characters
- DNS names can contain only alphabetical characters (A-Z), numeric characters (0-9), minus sign (-), and period (.)
