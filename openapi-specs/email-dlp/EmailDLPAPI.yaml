    as an additional vector of Enterprise DLP. To prevent sensitive data exfiltration,
    Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (E-DLP) performs inline inspection of all outbound
    emails. Email DLP then inspects outbound emails and sends the emails to Enterprise
    DLP for inspection and verdict rendering.


    Depending on your instance location, the endpoint URL can change. The Email DLP
    endpoint is region specific.

        ```\nUsing the limit query, the response contains a `next-batch` field that\
        \ you can use to obtain the next page of results. The response will contain\
        \ the next endpoint based on the delta:\n```\n\"nextLink\": \"incident/api/incidents/delta?limit=100&from=2021-05-21T01:02:56Z&to=2021-05-22T01:02:56Z\"\

        \ the incdent with the [DLP API](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/enterprise-dlp/enterprise-dlp-api/reports/retrieve-reports).\n\
