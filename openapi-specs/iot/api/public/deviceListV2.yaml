parameters:
- description: An optional string that sets the start of a time range for devices to retrieve. This is the time when a device was last active. (It's unnecessary to set etime=now or etime=<time> because it is always treated as now.)

  name: stime
  required: false
  schema:
    type: string
    format: date-time
- description: An optional integer that sets the number of items to skip

  name: offset
  required: false
  schema:
    type: integer
- description: An optional integer that sets the number of items in one response; that is, in one page. The maximum page length you can set is 1000. The default page length for alerts, devices, and vulnerability instances is 1000. Because of these high default values, we recommend setting the page length to a smaller number, especially for alerts and vulnerabilities.
  in: query
  name: pagelength
  required: false
  schema:
    type: integer
    maximum: 1000
- description: A comma-separated list of device fields to include in the response. Maximum of 50 fields can be specified. Available fields can be retrieved from the device/attributes api. If omitted, only common attributes are returned (attributes specific to a third party will not be returned in this case).
  in: query

  in: query
  name: site_names
  required: false
  schema:
    type: string
  example: 'site_1,site_2'
- description: The alphanumeric order in which devices are displayed. asc indicates an ascending order from smallest to largest. desc, which is the default, indicates a descending order from largest to smallest.
  in: query
  name: sortdirection
  required: false
  schema:
    type: string
    enum:
    - asc
    - desc
