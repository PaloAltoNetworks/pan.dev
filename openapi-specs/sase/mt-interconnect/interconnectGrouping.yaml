    This Open API spec file represents the APIs available for
    [Palo Alto Networks Interconnect](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/NEED-URL) APIs. 
    The Service Provider Interconnect API enables you to manage and monitor your network infrastructure efficiently. This documentation covers operations for Backbone, Connections, and IP Pools. 

    These APIs use the common SASE authentication mechanism and base URL. See the
    [Prisma SASE API Get Started](https://pan.dev/sase/docs/getstarted) guide for more information.

    This Open API spec file was created on %%date%%. To check for a more recent version of this file, see

    Backbone:
        title: Backbone API
        description: |
            A Backbone is a virtual grouping of network connections. It serves as the core structure around which other elements like connections and tenants are organized. 
            Managing a backbone allows you to oversee the connections and tenants associated with it, providing a centralized point for monitoring and control.

    Connection:
        title: Connection API
        description: |
            A Connection represents a link between different network segments or regions. Creating and managing connections allows for the integration and interaction of various parts of your network infrastructure. 
            Each connection is associated with a specific backbone, enabling detailed monitoring and management.

    Region:
        title: Region API
        description: |
            You can select or assign an IP Pool to a region of your choice from the given list.

            - Region Api
            
    TenantInformation:
        title: Tenant Information API
        description: |
            A Tenant is an entity or a customer that is associated with a backbone.
        tags:
            - Tenant Info Api

    BackboneMonitoring:
        title: Backbone Monitoring API
        description: |
            Monitor the performance and status of all backbones. You can track egress and ingress throughput, view detailed egress and ingress statistics, and monitor egress and ingress throughput by providing tenant information. Additionally, you can view egress and ingress statistics by tenant and get an autogenerated summary of the backbone's overall performance and status.

            - Backbone Monitoring Api

    ConnectionMonitoring:
        title: Connection Monitoring API
        description: |
            Monitor the performance and details of all connections. This includes providing connection statistics, latency details, and connection statistics through egress and ingress throughput. Additionally, you can monitor egress and ingress traffic for each connection.
        tags:
            - Connection Monitoring Api

    IPPool:
        title: IP Pool API
        description: |
            An IP Pool is a collection of IP addresses that can be assigned to different regions within your network. You can either use IP address provided by Prisma Access or bring your own IP address. Managing IP pools includes creating,updating,assigning to regions, and deleting IP pools based on your network requirements.

    IPPoolMonitor:
        title: IP Pool Monitoring API
        description: |
            Provides details on the IP Pool usage.
