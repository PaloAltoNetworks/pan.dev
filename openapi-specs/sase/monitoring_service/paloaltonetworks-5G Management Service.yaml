  description: "The evolution of 5G technology is transforming enterprise connectivity,\
    \ offering unprecedented speed and capacity. \nAs businesses embrace 5G networks,\
    \ the demand for robust security measures grows exponentially. \nService Providers\
    \ are at the forefront of this shift, tasked with safeguarding vast amounts of\
    \ sensitive data across diverse 5G-connected devices.\nTraditional security approaches\
    \ fall short in the 5G landscape. Embedded solutions often hit scalability roadblocks\
    \ and increase management complexity. \nOver-the-Top (OTT) solutions, while flexible,\
    \ prove impractical for many IoT devices and sensors. Neither fully addresses\
    \ the unique challenges of 5G, \nsuch as seamless roaming and integrated network-based\
    \ security.\n\nThis gap in the market calls for an innovative security paradigm\
    \ - one that combines scalability, ease of management, \nand comprehensive protection\
    \ across all 5G scenarios. \nThe Enterprise 5G Security Solution emerges as the\
    \ answer to these pressing needs, \noffering a new approach to securing the future\
    \ of enterprise connectivity.\n\nThese APIs use the common SASE authentication\
    \ mechanism and base URL. See the\n[Prisma SASE API Get Started](https://pan.dev/sase/docs/getstarted)\
    \ guide for more information.\n\nThis Open API spec file was created on April\
