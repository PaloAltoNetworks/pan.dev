### What is DSPM?
Data security posture management (DSPM) is a set of practices and technologies used to assess, monitor, and reduce the risk related to data residing in cloud data stores – focusing on multi-cloud environments. DSPM is data-centric: it looks at the context and content of the data being protected, placing the focus on sensitive records such as PII or medical records. Thus, it enables the client to prioritize their data assets’ most critical configurations, risks, and usage by: 
* Fixing data misconfigurations to lower the overall risk of an attack 
* Tightening access permissions to reduce data exposure 
* Accelerating assessments of how data security posture is enforced, thus involving data owners in decisions directly related to data access

### What is Prisma Cloud DSPM?
Prisma Cloud DSPM is an agentless, multi-cloud, data security platform that discovers, classifies, protects, and governs sensitive data. As more and more organizations shift to manage their data assets in the cloud, this process requires implementation of better data monitoring capabilities. Prisma Cloud DSPM provides organizations with such capabilities, which ensure complete visibility and real-time control over potential security risks to their data.

### Prisma Cloud DSPM APIs
The Prisma Cloud DSPM API enables organizations to customize and automate DSPM workflows for their specific needs. The DSPM API empowers organizations to adapt and scale Prisma Cloud DSPM to their unique cybersecurity requirements from handling threat alerts and configuring security policies, to integration with specialized tools.

For more details on DSPM overall architecture and threat management details, refer to [DSPM Documentation](https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/enterprise-edition/content-collections/data-security-posture-management/data-security-posture-management).
