- description: Optional field setting the start of a time range for retrieving vulnerability instances. For example, to get all instances since November 3, 2020, starting at 00:00 AM in the Pacific Time Zone(UTC-8), the start time would be <b>stime=2020-11-3T08:00Z</b>. <br />If you prefer to specify the time in your local time rather than adjusting it to UTC time, you can also format the start time as <b>2020-11-03T:00:00-08:00</b>. Especially when starting at a later hour in the day, this format involves less calculating. For example, if you want to get vulnerability instances starting from 6:00 PM on November 3, 2020, entering <b>2020-11-03T18:00-08:00</b> is much simpler than entering <b>2020-11-04T02:00Z</b>.

- description: "The number of items in one response; that is, in one page. The default page length for vulnerabilities is 1000 and the maximum is 1000. Setting a shorter length improves response times. Note: The <b>pagelength</b> parameter is only valid when grouping vulnerability instances by device, not when grouping them by vulnerability."

- description: "In addition to the pagelength parameter, offset gets items on subsequent pages. For example, if the page length of your first request is 100, you get the first 100 vulnerabilities. To get the next 100, add offset=100 to your second request. This skips the first 100 vulnerabilities and gets the next 100 starting from 101.

Each <b>groupby</b> option results in a different JSON object structure in the response. <b>groupby=vulnerability</b> (the default) organizes results into groups by vulnerability. Each vulnerability and the device IDs impacted are an item in the items list. <b>groupby=device</b> organizes results into groups by device ID. Each device ID and a single vulnerability are an item in the items list. <br /> To request all vulnerability instances for a specific device, the value is the string <b>vulnerability</b> followed by <b>&deviceid='<'device_id'>'</b>, where the device ID is either a MAC address or, for static IP devices, an IP address. (Entering an IP address for a device whose device identifier is a MAC address doesn’t work. Similarly, entering a MAC address for a device whose device identifier is an IP address also doesn’t work.)"
