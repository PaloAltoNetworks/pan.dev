## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Prisma SASE API Quick Start

SASE APIs make use of [SASE Services](/sase-services/docs), which offer a common authentication
mechanism and base URL. To make API calls, you must first create a service account and in that process
obtain:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Token Service Group ID (TSG_ID)

You can then use the [Authentication Service](/sase-services/api/auth-service) to [obtain an access
token](/sase-services/docs/access-tokens). 

All APIs that use the SASE Services
must use HTTPS and HTTP/1.1. All API calls go to:

`https://api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com`

## Make an API call

When you make an API call, provide your access token on the request using the `Authorization` HTTP
header using the `Bearer` keyword. 

For example, using curl:

    curl -o --location "https://api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com/config/v1/jobs" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
