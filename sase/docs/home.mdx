Prisma SASE offers a [suite of cloud-delivered products](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase.html) 
that provide network configuration and network
security services. This suite of software offers network security for an enterprise's users, no
matter where they might be physically located, be it in the office or from a remote location.

The Prisma SASE APIs described here are intended to enable automation and integration solutions for
Prisma SASE products and services.

Currently, Prisma SASE offers the following APIs:

* [Tenancy Service](/sase/api/tenancy)
* [Identity and Access Management Service](/sase/api/iam)
* [Authentication Service](/sase/api/auth)
* [Subscription Service](/sase/api/subscription)
* [Prisma Access Configuration](/sase/docs/prisma-access-config/prisma-access-config)
* [Aggregate Monitoring](/sase/docs/mt-monitor)
* [Prisma Access Insights](/sase/docs/insights)

Most of these APIs use a common authentication mechanism and base URL. See [Get Started](/sase/docs/getstarted) for details.
Prisma Access Insights, however, uses different mechanisms for authentication and base URL. See the
[Prisma Access Insights API overview](/sase/docs/insights) for more information.
