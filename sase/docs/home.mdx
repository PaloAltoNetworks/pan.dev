## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Welcome to the Prisma SASE APIs

Prisma SASE offers a [suite of cloud-delivered products](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase.html) 
that provide network configuration and network
security services. This suite of software offers network security for an enterprise's users, no
matter where they might be physically located, be it in the office or from a remote location.

The Prisma SASE APIs described here are intended to enable automation and integration solutions for
anyone who is deploying Prisma SASE products and services.

Currently, Prisma SASE offers the following APIs:

* [Prisma Access Configuration](/sase/docs/prisma-access-config/prisma-access-config)
* [Prisma SASE Multitenant Platform](/sase/docs/msp)

These APIs use [SASE Services](/sase-services/docs) for a common authentication mechanism and base
URL.
