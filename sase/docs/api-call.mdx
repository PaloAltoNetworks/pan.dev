You can make an API call to a SASE service when you have done all of the following:

1. Created at least one [TSG](/sase/docs/tenant-service-groups).
2. Created at least one [service account](/sase/docs/service-accounts).
3. Assigned a [role](/sase/docs/roles) to the service account.
4. Obtained an [access token](/sase/docs/access-tokens).

To make an API call, provide your access token on the request using the `Authorization` HTTP
header using the `Bearer` keyword.

For example, using curl:

    curl -o --location "https://api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com/config/v1/jobs" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
