## Preview Documentation

** This documentation is in an early preview state. It is subject to change without notice. **

## Overview ##

After you have configured your tenants, these APIs can be used to perform aggregated monitoring queries for information about applications, threats, URLs, and licenses across all your tenants of a Prisma Access instance. 

The functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the [Prisma SASE Multitenant Platform user interface](https://stage.docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform/monitor-tenants) user.

See the [Prisma SASE Multitenant Platform API docs](/sase/docs/msp) for more information about how to use the information in this API reference.
