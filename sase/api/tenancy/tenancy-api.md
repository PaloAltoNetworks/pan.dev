The Tenancy Service is used to create [tenant service groups](/sase/docs/tenant-service-groups), 
or TSGs. A TSG is essentially a container that is used to build your tenant hierachy. You can use
the multitenant user interface to create a TSG (that is, to create a tenant), or you can use the
[Identity and Access Management API](/sase/api/iam/serviceaccounts#operation/createservice_account).

Once you have a TSG, you can create a [service account](/sase/docs/service-accounts) for it. 
When you create a service account, you get a Client ID and Client Secret. which you need in order to 
[get an access token](/sase/api/auth-service/authservice#tag/AuthService).
You must also use your TSG's ID when you create an access token.

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
