The Prisma Access Insights 2.0 APIs allow you to query your Prisma Access Insights tenants for server
status and data resources. These 2.0 APIs are intended to support Managed Security Service Providers
(MSSPs) who are managing tenants in a multi-tenant environment. If you are a customer who is
managing Prisma Access Insights tenants in a single tenant environment, please use the
[1.0 APIs](/sase/api/insights/1.0).


For information about access tokens and base URLs, please see 
[Get Started with Prisma Access 2.0 APIs](/sase/docs/insights/getting_started-20).
