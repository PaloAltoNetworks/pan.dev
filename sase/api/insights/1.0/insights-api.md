The Prisma Access Insights 1.0 APIs allow you to query your Prisma Access
Insights tenant for server status and data resources. These 1.0 APIs are 
intended to support customers who are managing Prisma Access Insights tenants
in a single tenant environment. If you are a Managed Security Service Provider
(MSSP)
who is managing tenants in a multi-tenant environment, please use the 
[2.0 APIs](/sase/api/insights/2.0).

For information about access tokens and base URLs, please see 
[Get Started with Prisma Access 1.0 APIs](/sase/docs/insights/getting_started-10).
