Welcome to the Prisma SASE Aggregate Monitoring APIs. To use these APIs, you must be a new Managed
Security Service Provider (MSSP) customer as of March 2022 and must have configured your multitenant
hierarchy for a new deployment of Prisma Access.

After you have configured your tenants, these APIs can be used to perform aggregated monitoring
queries for information about applications, threats, URLs, and licenses across all your tenants of a
Prisma Access instance. 

The functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the [Prisma SASE Multitenant
Platform user
interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/sase/prisma-sase-multitenant-platform/monitor-tenants).

See the [Prisma SASE Multitenant Platform API docs](/sase/docs/mt-monitor) for more information about 
how to use the information in this API reference.

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
