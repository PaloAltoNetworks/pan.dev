# Welcome to the Cortex Data Lake Log Forwarding APIs

Welcome to the Cortex Data Lake Log Forwarding APIs. To use these APIs, you must be a new Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) customer as of March 2022 and must have configured your multitenant hierarchy for a new deployment of Prisma Access.
After you have configured your tenants, these APIs can be used to add, modify, and delete syslog, HTTPS, and email log forwarding profiles.

The functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the [Cortex Data Lake user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-data-lake/cortex-data-lake-getting-started/get-started-with-log-forwarding-app).
