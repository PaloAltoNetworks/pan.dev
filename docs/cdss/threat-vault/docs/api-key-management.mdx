To generate or revoke the API key:

1. Log in to the [Palo Alto Networks Customer Service Portal](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com) with an account that has Super User privileges.
2. Select `Assets` and then `API Key Management`.
3. From the `Select an API key` drop down, select the API key based on the subscription type.
4. Click `Regenerate` to generate a new key. If you suspect that an API key may be compromised, you can generate a new key, which automatically invalidates the old key. Keep in mind, you can only have one active API key at any given time.
5. Select `Disable` if you no longer plan to use the key. Disabling the API key revokes it from further use.
