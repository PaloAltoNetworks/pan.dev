You can make an API call when the following requirements have been met:

1. Verify that you have an active CDSS subscription associated with the API service that you want to use. For information about licensing, refer to [product documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/licensing-registration-activation) or review your entitlements on the [Palo Alto Networks Support Portal](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/).
2. Retrieve an API key. The API key is part of the access control scheme and authenticates your requests to the respective CDSS API service.
3. (Recommended) Review the [Cloud-Delivered Security Services Developer's Guide](../docs) and the API Reference guide for the API service that you wish to leverage.

Once you have an API key for authentication, you can use that API key to make calls to the API service for which the key was generated for. API keys do not operate across different product lines and services.

To make an API call, you must provide the API key in the header using the `X-API-KEY` parameter name. In this Threat Vault API request, the base URI (https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats) and the unique threat ID are also specified.

For example, using curl:

```shell-session
curl -H 'X-API-KEY: api_key' 'https://api.threatvault.paloaltonetworks.com/service/v1/threats?id=30001'
```

The response for this Threat Vault API example, which retieves information about a specific threat signature ID, displays detailed information about a vulnerability with a unique threat ID of 30001, known as: Novell GroupWise iCal RRULE Time Conversion Invalid Array Indexing Vulnerability.
