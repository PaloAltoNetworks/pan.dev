In this section we describe the concept of tasks in Expedition, how to create them, monitor them and cancel them.

### Description

Some of the background tasks in Expedition 2.0 are better performed within jobs that can be monitored, are non-blocking and in some cases, can be cancelled.
Importing a configuration is one of such actions as, depending on the configuration size, the required time for importing may be excessive for a blocking code.

In general terms, jobs are meant to be handled by an `Agent` in Expedition that should be started in advance. See [Managing Expedition's Agent](managing_expedition_agent) section for more information.  
In a general view, jobs are created in Expedition depending on the type of request that it is being submitted. When a request has potential to require a certain amount of time to be completed,
this is executed as a job by the Expedition agent.

### Example of a Job Creation

The process of importing a configuration is an example of a task that is executed by the `Agent` as a `job`.
All tasks requests that become executed within jobs will answer back with a job_id that can later be monitored or cancelled (_note: cancelling may not be allowed for all type of tasks_).

The following JSON exemplifies the response that a request will generate when a job is created.
Notice that the response includes the `jobId` (1619 in this case) and a brief description on the job type and its status.
The jobId can be collected through the JSON path `Contents->response->data->content->system->jobs->jobId`

```json
{
  "Type": "success",
  "success": true,
  "Contents-Format": "json",
  "Contents": {
    "code": 0,
    "success": true,
    "cacheable": false,
    "metadata": {},

      "total": 1,

      "per-page": 10,
      "total-pages": 1,

      },

        "total-objects": null,
        "fields": null,
        "columns": null,
        "content": {
          "system": {
            "jobs": {

                "statusCode": 1,
                "statusMessage": "Completed"
              },
              "TasksMsg": ["Completed. Filter executed successfully"],
              "nextStep": []
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Checking Job status

Within an answer of a job status, we can explore the current state of its execution.
The `state` field will provide a numeric value that represents the execution percentage (from 0 - 0% to 1 - 100%).

Once the execution is completed, having the state to 1, it would be the moment to request the task response.

The calls comply with the following structure:

| Example | <small>`https://localhost/api/v1/job/status/1619`</small>    | <small>_in url_<br/> jobId: 1619</small>             |

    echo('Importing configuration: '+ str(round($percentage,2))+ '%')
}

curl_close($curl);
```

### Cancelling a Job

Certain jobs can be cancelled on demand if no side consequences would impact on the current project.
To request the cancellation of a job, we need to call the folloging URL with the DELETE method with the `jobId` that wants to be cancelled.

If a job gets cancelled, its `state` will be modified to `-1`.
If a job cannot be cancelled, its execution will continue uninfluenced, its `state` will keep reflecting the current execition percentage
and a message will inform that the current job cannot be cancelled.

| Method  | EndPoint                                              | Parameters                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| DELETE  | <small>`https://localhost/api/v1/job/<jobId>`</small> | <small>_in url_<br/>**jobId** : job id value</small> |
| Example | <small>`https://localhost/api/v1/job/1619`</small>    | <small>_in url_<br/> jobId: 1619</small>             |

    echo "The job has been cancelled";

### Getting the Job result

Once a job is completed, it is then possible to continue with the next steps in the user's workflow.
In some cases, the job can suggest a next step that it is meaningful given the current completed task.  
For instance, after a configuration has been imorted to the device, the next step would be assign device with configuration to the project.
