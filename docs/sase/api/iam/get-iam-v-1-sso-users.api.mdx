## Verify a user account



Verify that the email address provided to this API corresponds to
an existing [login account](/sase/docs/user-accounts#log-in-accounts).

This API contains a JSON object in it&#39;s response. If the 
`profile_exists` field in that object is `true`, then the
email address is associated with a login account. 

If `profile_exists` is `false`, a login account is not found for this email address.
In that case, a login account must be created for the user before
the user can perform the actions identified by any access policies
assigned to the user&#39;s account.
