To obtain an access token using Authentication Service, you must have already
[created at least one TSG](/sase/docs/tenant-service-groups)
and [created a service account](/sase/docs/service-accounts) that has role-access to it.
When you did these things, you obtained:

- A TSG ID, which you use to identify the scope of the access token.
- A Client ID
- A Client Secret

Using this information, you can use
[POST /oauth2/access_token](/sase/api/auth/post-auth-v-1-oauth-2-access-token)
to create an access token. Be aware that:

- The FQDN for the authentication service is different from the rest of the SASE APIs. It is:

  `https://auth.apps.paloaltonetworks.com`

- This API uses basic auth. Use your Client ID for the username, and Client Secret for the password.

- Use the `scope` field to provide the TSG ID.

For example:

    curl -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=TSG_ID:<tsg_id>" \
    -u <client_id>:<client_secret> \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -X POST https://auth.apps.paloaltonetworks.com/oauth2/access_token

**Note**: The service account that you use to authenticate this request must belong to the TSG that
you identify on the `scope` field. See [Acess Token Scopes](/sase/docs/scope) for more information.

Access tokens have a lifespan of 15 minutes.
