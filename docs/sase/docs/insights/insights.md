# Prisma Access Insights API

Welcome to the Prisma Access Insights APIs. These APIs allow you to query your Prisma Access
Insights tenants for server status and data resources. There are two versions of the APIs, each of
which offers identical functionality. However, the 2.0 APIs are meant for new Managed Security
Service Providers (MSSPs) who purchased their licenses no sooner than March 2022. The 1.0 APIs are
meant for traditional single tenant customers.

MSSP customers should begin with [Getting Started with the 2.0 APIs](/sase/docs/insights/getting_started-20).

Single tenant customers should begin with [Getting Started with the 1.0 APIs](/sase/docs/insights/getting_started-10).
