behave as a reverse proxy between a User-ID enabled application and a PAN-OS NGFW.

## User-ID API and External Dynamic List (EDL)

They're probably the most common way to share external IP metadata with the NGFW. The Use
cases for them are enormous: from blocking known DoS sources to forward traffic from specific
IP addresses on low latency links.

Let's take for instance the following logs generated by the SSH daemon in a linux host.

```text
Apr 12 16:00:40 raspberrypi sshd[8381]: Accepted publickey for xhoms from 192.168.1.31 port 56842 ssh2: RSA SHA256:umL2q3TS9quZ2y+3a7asRh+SuZSrwMeCuUPQTXTNQX0
Apr 12 16:00:40 raspberrypi sshd[8381]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user xhoms by (uid=0)
Apr 12 16:00:40 raspberrypi systemd-logind[282]: New session 2506 of user xhoms.
Apr 12 16:00:40 raspberrypi systemd: pam_unix(systemd-user:session): session opened for user xhoms by (uid=0)
```

Won't it be great to have a way to share the IP addresses used by the user **xhoms** with the NGFW
so specific security policies are applied to traffic sourced by that address just because we now know
the endpoint is being managed by that user?

The following Shell CGI script could be used to create an External Dynamic List (EDL) that would
list all known IP addresses the account _xhoms_ was used to login into this server.

```sh
cat /var/log/auth.log | sed -En 's/.*[[:space:]]sshd.*Accepted publickey for xhoms from ([^[:space:]]*).*/\1/p'
```

That is great but:

- When would address be removed from the list? At the daily log rollout?
- Are all listed IP addresses still being operated by the user _xhoms_?
- Is there any way to remove addresses from the list at user logout?

To overcome these (and many other) limitations Palo Alto Networks NGFW feature a very powerful
IP tagging API called User-ID. Although EDL and User-ID cover similar objectives there are
fundamental technical differences between them:

- User-ID is "asynchronous" (push mode) and provides a very flexible way to create groupings. Either
  by tagging address objects (Dynamic Address Group - DAG ) or by mapping users to addresses and
  then tagging these users (Dynamic User Group - DUG)
- EDL is "universal". Almost all network appliance vendors provide a feature to fetch an IP address
  list from a URL.

Years ago it was up to the end customer to create its own connectors. Just like the CGI script we
shared before. But as presence of PAN-OS powered NGFW's grown among enterprise customers more application
vendors decided to leverage the User-ID value by providing API clients out-of-the-box. Althought this is
great (for Palo Alto Network customers) losing the option to fetch a list from a URL (EDL mode) makes it
more difficult to integrate legacy technologies that might be out there still in the network.

## Hijacking User-ID messages with a proxy

Let's assume you have an application that features a PAN-OS User-ID API client and that is capable
of pushing log entries to the PAN-OS NGFW in an asynchronous way. Let's assume, as well, that there
are still some legacy network devices in your network that need to fetch that address metadata from
a URL. How difficult it would be to create a micro-service for that?

One option would be to leverage a PAN-OS XML SDK like [PAN Python](https://panos.pan.dev/docs/apis/panpython_qs)
or [PAN GO](https://panos.pan.dev/docs/apis/pango_qs) and to create a REST API that extracts the
current state from the PAN-OS device using its OP API.

```text title="getting DAG state from PAN-OS XML API"
GET https://<pan-os-device>/api
    ?key=<API-KEY>
    &type=op
    &cmd=<show><object><registered-ip><all></all></registered-ip></object></show>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<response status="success">
  <result>
    <entry ip="10.10.10.11" from_agent="0" persistent="1">
      <tag>
        <member>tag10</member>
      </tag>
    </entry>
    <entry ip="10.10.10.10" from_agent="0" persistent="1">
      <tag>
        <member>tag10</member>
      </tag>
    </entry>
    <count>2</count>
  </result>
</response>
```

It shouldn't be that difficult to parse the response and provide a plain list out of it.
In fact, if you're in for a challenge, I'd let you think about using a XSLT processor to
pipe it at the output of a cURL command and pack everything as a CGI script.

But in this tutorial we're going to levarage the GO Package https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xhoms/panoslib/uid
to follow a diferent approach: we'll hijack User-ID messages by implementing a micro-service
that behaves as a reverse proxy between the application that features the User-ID client and
the PAN-OS device. I like this approach because it opens the door to other use cases like
enforcing timeout (adding timeout to entries that do not have it), converting DAG messages
into DUG equivalents or adding additional tags based on the source application.

### Building a reverse-proxy micro-service skeleton

GO's http package is great. And its [httputil](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil) package
companion contains a ready-to-use reverse proxy type. Building the foundation of our
tutorial is a 4-line code exercise.

```go
hostport := "<panos-device>:443"
url, _ := url.Parse("https://" + hostport)
proxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(url)
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", proxy)
```

Next step is to provide a minimum of configuration options allowing the user to provide:

- the target PAN-OS device (`hostport`) and
- the TCP to bound our micro-service to (defaulting to `8080`)

Let's then use the following version as the foundation for our reverse proxy application

```go
func main() {
    var url *url.URL
    if hostport, exists := os.LookupEnv("TARGET"); exists {
        if target, err := url.Parse("https://target"); err == nil {
            log.Fatalf("https://%v is not a valid url", hostport)
        } else {
            url = target
        }
    } else {
        log.Fatal("mandatory TARGET env variable not provided")
    }
    port := "8080"
    if envport, exists := os.LookupEnv("PORT"); exists {
        port = envport
    }
    proxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(url)
    log.Printf("attempting to start micro-service on %v", port)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, proxy))
}
```

### Monitoring the User-ID messages

Next goal is to be able to monitor the User-ID messages sent to the PAN-OS device.
To acomplish that we need to capture transactions that conform to the following
schema:

- pattern equals `/api/`
- methods GET or PUT
- parameter `type` (either in Query String or POST payload) equals to `user-id`

We'll leverage GO http's routing capability by creating two handlers. One of them
will process all requests sent to `/api/` while the other one will behave like
a default route (`/`). In any case, the request will need to be forwarded to the
PAN-OS device. So let's create a type that will hold the reverse proxy and that
will implement the two handlers.

```go
type manInMiddle struct {
	proxy *httputil.ReverseProxy
}

func newManInMiddle(url *url.URL) (m manInMiddle) {
	m = manInMiddle{
		proxy: httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(url),
	}
	return
}

func (m manInMiddle) defaultHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	m.proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}

func (m manInMiddle) apiHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	m.proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}
```

And now let's change the application main's method final lines to configure routing
instead of a dedicated handler for all requests.

```go
//...
mim := newManInMiddle(url)
http.HandleFunc("/api/", mim.apiHandler)
http.HandleFunc("/", mim.defaultHandler)
log.Printf("attempting to start micro-service on %v", port)
log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil))
```

Finally we need to implemente the `apiHandler()` to extract the User-ID messages
(`cmd` parameter) by:

- reading parameters from the URL Query String for GET requests or
- performing the following tasks in case of POST requests
  1. read the request body and keep a safe copy
  2. re-set the body to be able to call `ParseForm()` and check if `type` equals `user-id`
     extracting `cmd` in such a case
  3. re-set the body to be able to invoke the reverse proxy

This is how the modified version of the `apiHandler()` looks like

```go
func (m manInMiddle) apiHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var err error
    if r.Method == http.MethodGet {
        if r.URL.Query().Get("type") == "user-id" {
            cmd := r.URL.Query().Get("cmd")
        }
    } else if r.Method == http.MethodPost {
        var body []byte
        if body, err = ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body); err == nil {
            r.Body = ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(body))
            if err = r.ParseForm(); err == nil {
                r.Body = ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(body))
                if r.Form.Get("type") == "user-id" {
                    cmd := r.Form.Get("cmd")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if err == nil {
        m.proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    } else {
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
        w.Write([]byte(err.Error()))
    }
}
```

### Creating the User-ID state

Now it is time to:

- parse the User-ID (XML) command we extracted and
- keep a simulated stated from reading the different mappings (user-ip, user-group and
  ip-tag) and honouring the provided time out values for each of them.

Fortunatelly we can leverage the packages https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xhoms/panoslib/collection,
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xhoms/panoslib/uid and
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xhoms/panoslib/uidmonitor to perform the heavy lifting.

The `uid` package features a User-ID payload builder that accepts many input formats, being an
existing User-ID payload one of them. Final actions of the builder (i.e. `UIDMessage()` or
`Payload()`) accept a type implementing the `uid.Monitor` interface. If present, then the
Monitor's `Log()` method would be called for each item in the User-ID payload.

The `uidmonitor` package provides the `MemMonitor` type that implements the `uid.Monitor`
interface by keeping a state of valid values in memory. `MemMonitor` features convenience
methods to dump current state as IP lists.

Let's change our `manInMiddle` type and `newManInMiddle()` initialization to keep a `MemMonitor`
variable.

```go
type manInMiddle struct {
	mm    *uidmonitor.MemMonitor
	proxy *httputil.ReverseProxy
}

func newManInMiddle(url *url.URL) (m manInMiddle) {
	m = manInMiddle{
		mm:    uidmonitor.NewMemMonitor(),
		proxy: httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(url),
	}
	return
}
```

And now let's implement a `process()` method that will drive our `MemMonitor` from
hijacked UserID messages in the api handler.

```go
func (m manInMiddle) process(cmd string) {
	var uidmsg *collection.UIDMessage = &collection.UIDMessage{}
	if err := xml.Unmarshal([]byte(cmd), uidmsg); err == nil {
		if uidmsg != nil {
			uid.NewBuilderFromPayload(uidmsg.Payload).
				Payload(m.mm)
		}
	}
}
```

Now we just need the `apiHandler()` to call `process()` for each User-ID command
extracted by our Man-in-the-Middle.

```go
//...
        if r.URL.Query().Get("type") == "user-id" {
            cmd := r.URL.Query().Get("cmd")
            m.process(cmd)
        }
//...
                if r.Form.Get("type") == "user-id" {
                    cmd := r.Form.Get("cmd")
                    m.process(cmd)
                }
```

### The "virtual" `/edl` endpoint

We're almost there. The only missing piece is a new handler capable of dumping our `MemMonitor` state.
As that state is organized by type (`TagIP()`, `UserIP()` and `GroupIP()`) we will first implement
a `list()` function to choose the right method with a switch/case statement.

```go
func (m manInMiddle) list(edl string, key string) (out []string) {
	m.mm.CleanUp(time.Now())
	switch edl {
	case "user":
		out = m.mm.UserIP(key)
	case "group":
		out = m.mm.GroupIP(key)
	case "tag":
		out = m.mm.TagIP(key)
	default:
		out = emptyEdl
	}
	return
}
```

Notice we call `MemMonitor`'s `CleanUp()` method with current time to have expired entries being removed
before the list is retrieved.

And now let's wrap this `list` function in a http handler that will extract required
parameters from a URL query string featuring the schema `?list=[user|group|tag]&key=<tag>`

```go
func (m manInMiddle) edlHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	out := &bytes.Buffer{}
	for _, item := range m.list(
		r.URL.Query().Get("list"),
		r.URL.Query().Get("key"),
	) {
		out.WriteString(string(item) + "\n")
	}
	w.Header().Add("content-type", "text/plain")
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	w.Write(out.Bytes())
}
```

Final step is to insert this new handler in the http router. We can use the `/edl`
endpoint as it won't conflict with current PAN-OS http service.

```go
mim := newManInMiddle(url, false)
http.HandleFunc("/edl", mim.edlHandler)
http.HandleFunc("/api/", mim.apiHandler)
http.HandleFunc("/", mim.defaultHandler)
log.Printf("attempting to start micro-service on %v", port)
log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil))
```

## Our micro-service in action

Let's perform a couple of test. First one will register two IP addresses with the tag `test`. One
of these entries would expire in 100 seconds while the second one would expire in just 10 seconds.

```xml
<uid-message>
	<type>update</type>
	<payload>
		<register>
			<entry ip="10.10.10.10">
				<tag>
					<member timeout="100">test</member>
				</tag>
			</entry>
			<entry ip="10.10.20.20">
				<tag>
					<member timeout="10">test</member>
				</tag>
			</entry>
		</register>
	</payload>
</uid-message>
```

Then we call the `/edl` endpoint twice giving enought time between attempts to allow one of
the entries to expire.

```text
GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/edl/
    ?list=tag
    &key=test

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:07:50 GMT
Content-Length: 24
Connection: close

10.10.20.20
10.10.10.10

...

GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/edl/
    ?list=tag
    &key=test

Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:08:55 GMT
Content-Length: 12
Connection: close

10.10.10.10
```

The next payload is a bit more complex. It maps (login) two users and then tags them to the group `admin`
with different timeouts.

```xml
<uid-message>
	<type>update</type>
	<payload>
		<register-user>
			<entry user="foo@test.local">
				<tag>
					<member timeout="100">admin</member>
				</tag>
			</entry>
			<entry user="bar@test.local">
				<tag>
					<member timeout="10">admin</member>
				</tag>
			</entry>
		</register-user>
		<login>
			<entry name="bar@test.local" ip="10.10.20.20" timeout="100"></entry>
			<entry name="foo@test.local" ip="10.10.10.10" timeout="100"></entry>
		</login>
	</payload>
</uid-message>
```

Again, we can experience one of the IP addresses being removed from the output at its
due time.

```text
GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/edl/
    ?list=group
    &key=admin

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:28:16 GMT
Content-Length: 24
Connection: close

10.10.20.20
10.10.10.10

...

GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/edl/
    ?list=group
    &key=admin

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

10.10.10.10
```
