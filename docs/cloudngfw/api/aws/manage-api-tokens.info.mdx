# Manage API Tokens



Generate JSON Web Token (JWT) to get programmatic access to authenticate API calls.  

Cloud NGFW Programmatic access allows you to create and manage NGFWs and rulestacks using REST APIs. Using these APIs, you can invoke actions on Cloud NGFW resources (NGFW and rulestacks) through an application or third-party tool.  

Cloud NGFW Programmatic access is disabled by default.  

For more information, see [Enable Programmatic Access for Cloud NGFW](/cloudngfw/aws/api).  

For information about roles and permissions, see [Cloud NGFW roles and permissions](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-ngfw/aws/cloud-ngfw-on-aws/getting-started-with-cloud-ngfw-for-aws/invite-users) table.
