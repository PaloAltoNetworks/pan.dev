# User Onboarding using Endpoint Role



Cloud NGFW requires you to onboard an AWS account to create and manage the resources required by Cloud NGFW. The Cloud NGFW service uses a Cloud Formation Template (CFT) stack to create these roles needed for Cloud NGFW to access resources in your AWS environment.
