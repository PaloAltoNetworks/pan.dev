# Manage Rulestacks



Rulestacks defines access control (App-ID, URL Filtering) and threat prevention behavior of Cloud NGFW resources. A rulestack includes a set of security rules, associated objects, and profiles.

A Cloud NGFW resource uses your rulestack definitions to protect the traffic by a two-step process. First, it enforces your rules on the to allow or deny your traffic. Second, it performs content inspection on the allowed traffic based on what you specify on the Security Profiles.
