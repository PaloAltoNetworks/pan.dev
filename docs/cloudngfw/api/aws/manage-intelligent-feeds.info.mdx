# Manage Intelligent Feeds



An intelligent feed, also called an external dynamic list, is a list that you or third-parties can host on an external web server. You can specify the Intelligence Feed as the source or destination of your security rule. The NGFW checks the hosted list at hourly or daily intervals, and enforces your security rules based on the latest entries on your list, without requiring you to make any configuration changes.  

For more information about feeds, see [EDL hosting service](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/edl-hosting-service.html).
