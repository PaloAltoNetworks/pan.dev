# Palo Alto Networks for Developers

This website is built using Docusaurus 2, a modern static website generator (which is currently in alpha).

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The `upstream/master` branch is linked to a Netlify site and will auto-deploy when changes are merged into `master`.
